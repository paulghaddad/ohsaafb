  <p class="no-indent">Art is one of my passions in life, which is why I created
  this blog over three years ago. I write about all genres of art, but am most
  fascinated by artists using technology, such as virtual reality, robots and
  artificial intelligence. In addition to blogging, I have contributed articles
  to several publications, including Professional Artist Magazine, Sculpture
  Magazine, and Create Hub.</p>
