<p class="no-indent"><em>How virtual reality may help video games solidify a
  place in the art world.</em></p>

<p>My heart races.  High up on a mountain, the fear of falling seems real.  Lush
vegetation and blue bodies of water look authentic; chirping birds and falling
rocks add to the experience.  The scenario of a person scaling a mountain is
lifelike&mdash;and I was only watching a clip of “The Climb,” a game being developed
by Crytek for virtual reality (VR), on my computer screen.</p>

<p>Crytek is not alone.  Companies and developers are racing to demonstrate the
potential of VR across industries.  Although VR can simulate the experience of
climbing a mountain, it can also take you to far off places&mdash;places you may not
otherwise go&mdash;like a Syrian refugee camp.  Or, as <em>TechCrunch</em> reports, a VR
headset and app can provide art tours that explain the works of Renoir, Monet
and Manet, among other art masters at The Courtauld Gallery in London.</p>

<p>VR has the opportunity to upend life as we know it.  But according to <em>The
  Economist</em>, video gamers will be the initial target for Sony, Oculus and Valve,
firms developing VR headsets. Given the possibilities of VR and its video game
focus among VR firms, it is worthy to reconsider a much debated topic: are video
games art?</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Critics often see video games as a means of entertainment or fun.  Despite
exhibitions consisting entirely or partially of video games at the Smithsonian
American Art Museum, Museum of Modern Art and Barbican Centre, whether video
games are a form of art has been a long-standing debate.  But views may shift
with the uptake of VR.  Indeed, VR could solidify video games as art.</p>

<p>“Video games are a serious medium of expression,” says Warren Spector, a
video game designer, in the book “The Art of Video Games.”  “The creators of
these games . . . think about the creative process in the same way that a
filmmaker does . . . in the same way that a musician or painter does.”  Creating
a video game involves the input of many, recognized video game designer and
producer Robin Hunick in “The Art of Video Games.”  The process can include
computer programmers and sound and graphic designers, among many others.
Although defining art is entirely subjective, VR amplifies attributes that
underscore the artistic qualities of video games.  That is to say, VR’s
immersive and multi-sensorial environment heightens video games’ evolving story
and emotional tenors.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>Total Immersion</strong></p>

<p>First take the immersive, 360 degree environment that VR prides itself on.
Playing a video game on a television is different than with a VR headset.  In
addition to the hardware variances, the experience of VR is a major
differentiating factor.  “Within minutes, I was deftly moving across a
sun-splashed mountainside,” Nick Statt, writer for The Verge, describes his
experience playing “The Climb” in a 2015 article, “crossing one arm over the other
and strategically letting go with one hand for a brief heart-racing fraction of
a second and grasping again with the other.” And when you turn to the side the
camera follows, he adds.</p>

<p>As VR continues to improve, so will the experience it creates&mdash;not only
visually in terms of graphics, but also from physical and auditory sensations
used in conjunction with the VR headset.  One example is “Impacto,” a prototype
being developed by Human-Computer Interaction lab that intends to bridge the
physical and virtual worlds.  Wearers of this device may feel a punch in a
boxing game, for instance, or the impact from kicking a soccer ball.  Another
example is “RealSpace 3D Audio”: 3D audio technology produced by VisiSonics, a
provider of 3D sound for video games, music, movies and VR.  These developments
seemingly enhance the VR experience, along with the stories told&mdash;and this is
where video games in VR excel.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>The emotive story</strong></p>

<p>Artists over the course of time have used art as a means of communication.
Recall the religious art from the Italian Renaissance.  Various artists told and
retold the stories of the life, death and Resurrection of Jesus, among other
religious narratives, in visual terms.  Or consider Abstract Expressionist
artist Jackson Pollock, who famously said “I want to express my feelings rather
than illustrate them,” in regards to his “gestural” painting technique.  Even
today in the 21st century, artists turn to art to tell stories.  Ai Weiwei is an
example: much of his work is political, thereby drawing social awareness to
events in China.  Although artists convey different messages over the course of
time, they are united by using art to communicate.  Video games are no
different, and VR helps convey these messages.</p>

<p>Video games communicate through the stories they tell.  “Narrative remains
extremely important because it gives you the opportunity to hook in
emotionally,” explains Jane Pinckard, Associate Director at the Center for Games
and Playable Media at the UC Santa Cruz Center, in the book “The Art of Video
Games.”  She goes on to say, “otherwise, a game’s mechanics might be interesting
but without that engagement, it feels a little cold or without purpose.”</p>

<p>“That Dragon, Cancer” is one such example.  It tells the story of a couple,
Ryan and Amy Green, and their young son’s battle with brain cancer.  Or consider
“Assassin’s Creed,” a historical-fiction game taking place during the third
crusade.  Despite the video game platform used, these games are powerful:
emotionally and intellectually engaging players into a story. Now imagine
playing these games in VR: being transported into an enveloping environment with
physical and auditory sensations. The stakes are much more real.</p>

<p>VR can heighten emotional impact. According to <em>The Economist</em>, VR’s
“all-enveloping nature” is one reason for this. “Clouds Over
Sidra,” a VR film, exemplifies VR’s emotional capacity.  Created by Chris Milk,
a director and filmmaker, and Gabo Arora, a United Nations advisor and
filmmaker, in association with Vrse.works, a VR company, this film takes viewers
to a place where few have been: a refugee camp in Jordan.  Instead of merely
seeing the world of a twelve-year-old Syrian refugee, Sidra, from a distance on
a screen, by donning a VR headset you are in it.  Because of this, “you feel her
humanity in a deeper way,” Milk argues. “You empathize with her in a deeper
way.”</p>

<p>Above all, it is important to remember the role of the viewer, or player,
when it comes to art.  Recall the words of artist Marcel Duchamp: “The creative
act is not performed by the artist alone.”  Duchamp recognized the importance of
an artwork’s viewer, adding that “the spectator brings the work in contact with
the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and
thus adds his contribution to the creative act.”  Like viewers of sculptures or
paintings, video game players also have a crucial role: they advance the
narrative, bringing the story to life.  Journalist Ann Bednarz gives this
example in a 2012 Network World article: two players starting a game at the same
point may have two different outcomes, depending how each player explores the
game.</p>

<p>Defining art has always been a challenge.  Not every video game is
compelling, just like not every painting or sculpture is.  Arguably, those
determining what constitutes as art will likely expand their criteria as industry boundaries continue to blend: think of computer
programmers turning to creative coding as a form of expression or artist groups
using the Internet of Things to create art.  That said, given VR’s improvements
in recent years and the many possibilities it offers, VR may be the step to
solidify a place for video games in the art world.</p>
