<p>A common theme in society today is the quest to be new and innovative&mdash;the cutting edge.  
Society is just waiting for yet the next great thing that will make life easier, receive information faster and to stay better connected.  The iPhone is a quintessential example.  The launch of the iPhone in 2007 revolutionized how we connect to the world: a phone that is essentially a computer, global positioning system (GPS), and with its endless applications, it can be anything from a flight tracker to a magazine.  The influx and influence of technology and the rapid rise of globalization are having a dramatic impact on society, culture and the arts today.  Consequently, the contemporary art movement can be questioned for not producing what David Joselit calls a ‘productive shock’ associated with avant-garde art, a term that refers to innovation or experimentation, particularly in art, culture and politics.  Thus, an important question worth pursuing is: Can the contemporary art movement be avant-garde?</p>

<p>David Joselit’s recent article, <em>On Aggregators</em>, poses an interesting and relevant argument on what the term, contemporary, means today.  He rightly points out how this word has changed from an adjective, once indicating recentness, to a noun, claiming itself as a period: <em>the</em> contemporary.  Mr. Joselit notes that the literal meaning of <em>con-temporary</em>&mdash;“with time”&mdash;is notably different from the avant-garde.  “Like the avant-garde, the contemporary can only go forward,” Mr. Joselit explains, “but unlike the avant-garde, the contemporary doesn’t have an <em>avant</em>: its forward movement does not carry the productive shock of being <em>in advance</em> . . . of being out of sync with its time.”  Yet, it is arguable whether contemporary art will ever be avant-garde, because of two critical factors: technology and globalization.</p>

<p>Technologies of all kinds&mdash;the Internet, iPhones, television, podcasts and computers&mdash;are ubiquitous in much of society today, resulting in a vast amount of stimuli experienced daily.  Everything competes for our attention.  The access, emphasis and reliability on technology are having a critical impact: an intense desire for the here and now, or the ‘spectacle immediacy,’ as the art historian, Richard Meyer calls it.  <em>On Aggregators</em> highlights Mr. Meyer’s frustration living in a world inundated with spectacle:</p>

<blockquote>The spectacular immediacy of the contemporary art world threatens to overwhelm our ability to think critically about the relation of the current moment to the past.</blockquote>  

<p class="no-indent">He argues society becomes blind by succumbing to spectacular culture&mdash;hindering the ability to think historically.  Therefore, condensing and understanding the vast quantities of information received today can function as a means to move beyond the spectacular moment in order to critically reflect on the past.  And, as movements such as modernism have demonstrated: looking back is critical to moving forward.  Thus, Nicolas Bourriaud’s notion of the semionaut is one way to makes sense of this mass consuming world.</p>

<p>Artists are not alone in this quest for understanding the contemporary world.  Art historians and writers also share this endeavor.  Mr. Bourriaud’s book, <em>Postproduction</em>, proposes the concept of the semionaut: one who creates original pathways through existing signs in our contemporary culture.  According to Bourriaud, a semionaut “imagines the links, the likely relations between disparate sites . . . this recycling of sounds, images, and forms implies incessant navigation within the meanderings of cultural history, navigation which itself becomes the subject of artistic practice.”  Thus, as Mr. Bourriaud claims, this act of reusing challenges a passive culture; artists today actively create new ways to see and understand our existing consumer world.</p>

<p>Christian Marclay is one such artist.  His piece, <em>The Clock</em>, exemplifies this notion of the semionaut by recycling material, thus creating an original pathway placed into a new context.  Comprised of thousands of film excerpts from the past 100 years, <em>The Clock</em> chronicles a 24-hour period in real time by often displaying a clock or watch.  Marclay’s film suggests a play between the familiar and unfamiliar: he strings existing films together to create a new, personal narrative.  Living in a world of mass consumption, the semionaut makes use of a world immersed with images and information.  By reusing existing forms, Marclay and other semionauts may not be revolutionizing art, but add to an existing dialogue, thereby giving function to existing forms in society.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Technology draws attention to the inequalities in the world through its easy access to information and images.  But, this is not the only important factor for defining the contemporary.  Globalization is just as significant.  The spread of globalization is found in almost every industry, including the arts.  David Joselit finds globalization alongside the literal meaning of contemporary, “with time,” problematic.  “This seemingly innocuous ‘with’ masks the dramatically uneven development of globalization,” Mr. Joselit argues, “for being together in time does nothing to redress economic disparity, as the victims of collapsed Bangladeshi garment factories producing inexpensive clothes for Western corporations can attest.”  Technology has greatly opened the conversation to the cultural, political and educational discrepancies that exist around the world.  People and groups from emerging markets&mdash;the Middle East, Brazil, and China, among many others&mdash;are making their voices heard through art.</p>

<p>The contemporary encompasses the unevenness of globalization, making it challenging to create a ‘productive shock’ in art.  Therefore, David Joselit offers the term, aggregator, as one that condones our current globalized state.  He explains:</p>

<blockquote>Aggregators are online services such as Contemporary Art Daily . . . that filter information for art-world consumption making it possible . . . to shape vast flows and reservoirs of art-world information through the digital template.</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Mr. Joselit further posits that aggregators consist of a multitude of individual parts from various locations in response to shared conditions&mdash;filtering a saturated world.  Although he notes that modern art created ways to comprehend accumulation, including the collage and archive, the aggregator is different: in montage, elements are incorporated into the overall composition and the components featured do not maintain an element of independence; and an archive is an inclusive selection based on a theme, period or event.  However, aggregators account for disparate parts.  Since society is exposed to and consumes an unprecedented amount of information today, the accumulation of heterogeneous elements makes the aggregator a suitable term, and a necessary action, for globalized world.</p>

<p>Mr. Joselit notes how Slavs and Tatars apply the aggregator concept in their work, as they explain: “The collision of different registers, different voices, different worlds, and different logics previously considered to be antithetical, incommensurate, or simply unable to exist in the same page, sentence, or space is crucial to our practice.”  Slavs and Tatars welcome differences, seemingly giving a voice to the common man.  While this tactic is pervasive today, individual differences, marginalized groups and social or cultural inequalities had a lesser voice in arts of the past.  Art today is tolerant of&mdash;and readily accepts&mdash;such diversity.  Social classes are more fluid, individuals and groups that were once dismissed now have a welcomed voice, and technology broadcasts these changes to the world.  This exposure results in a desensitized art-viewing public, and poses a greater challenge for contemporary artists to create a ‘productive shock.’
</p>

<p>Technological advances and globalization make the ‘productive shock’ of the avant-garde unattainable in art today.  Yet, there are ways to make sense of a world defined by mass consumption and diversity; while not limited to these two terms, semionauts and aggregators are two such examples.  Therefore, with the rise of technology and globalization, avant-garde may not be an appropriate comparison or expectation for the contemporary art movement.  Rather, it is technology, whose many inventions, including the iPhone, have undoubtedly created a ‘productive shock.’  While the contemporary art movement may not be revolutionary in the avant-garde sense of the word, art today is still progressing&mdash;it is still “with time”&mdash;while also taking on two monumental tasks: trying to make sense of a technologically advanced society in a globalized world.  It is only once we learn to deal with the present that one can look at the past in order to make a more dramatic move forward in the future.</p>
