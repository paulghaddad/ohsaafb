<p>As a woman in her early forties, Edith Farnsworth envisioned a weekend
retreat to relax in the country&mdash;a break from her busy life as a doctor in
Chicago in the 1940s. What she got was an expensive "glass box."</p>

<p>Farnsworth met German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at a dinner party in
1945.  When she shared her vision for her weekend getaway, Mies offered to help.
What began as a friendly relationship in 1945 ruptured by 1951.  The house’s
estimated cost of $40,000 ballooned to almost $74,000.  After paying tens of
thousands of dollars more than anticipated, Farnsworth stopped paying bills and
declined to accept the furniture Mies intended to furnish the house
with.<sup>1</sup>  A lengthy lawsuit ensued, which created public attention and attracted people to see a house comprised of transparent walls in Plano, Illinois, some 50 miles west of Chicago.<sup>2</sup> </p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Mies helped define modern architecture by using industrial materials and
emphasizing open spaces.<sup>3</sup>  Prior to the Farnsworth House, he designed
eminent European works, including the German Pavilion at the Barcelona World’s
Fair in 1929 and the Tugendhat House in the Czech Republic.  Mies’s chance meeting with Farnsworth was a dream come true for the architect who emigrated to the United States in 1938.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Farnsworth, however, eventually realized his true motive, explains art
historian Alice Friedman: “What Mies wanted, and what he thought he had found in
[Farnsworth], was a patron who would put her budget and her needs aside in favor
of his own goals and dreams as an architect.”<sup>5</sup>  Seeing Farnsworth’s plot of land in Plano near the Fox River, Mies recognized the possibility of building a structure to be one with nature, characterized by open spaces and industrial materials.<p>

<p>Today, you can get a physical and mental glimpse of the former house, now a
museum.  You may gawk at this iconic piece of modern architecture, which it is.
Or you may be enthralled with the experience the Farnsworth House produces, and
how this experience changes over time: from idyllic thoughts of being united with nature to the practical challenges a glass house brings. These experiential qualities make a trip to the Farnsworth House worthwhile.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>One with nature</strong></p>

<p>A glass house life has its benefits.  Being united with nature is one.
Imagine waking up to sweeping landscape views and the nearby Fox River: lush
green grass, billowing trees and burgeoning flowers surround the property.
“Expensive wallpaper,” is how Philip Johnson, an architect who constructed his
own glass house in New Haven, Connecticut, described the views of his house. </p>

<p>Picturesque ideas flood your mind while driving along the country roads
towards the Farnsworth House. The same positive feelings continue when you begin
the house tour: walking along the half-mile path towards the house led by a
museum docent. Shaded by trees and a peaceful atmosphere makes for an enjoyable
experience, a prelude of what’s to come.</p>

<p>Eventually, you approach a geometrically shaped construct supported by white
I-beams and raised over five feet above ground.  The simplicity of this house
juxtaposed with the beauty of the surrounding nature&mdash;rolling waves from the
nearby Fox River and patches of flowers beginning to bloom&mdash;bring a house devoid
of ornamentation and color to life.  Life in a glass house seems appealing from
the outside.  Appearances, however, can be deceiving.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>The reality of a glass house life</strong></p>

<p>“No one knows what it is like to live in a glass house," Farnsworth famously
said.  She is right.  This 2,400 square foot house&mdash;comprised of almost an
entirely open floor plan and divided by a wooden core&mdash;enlivens the senses and
penetrates the psyche.  Fantasies of a glass house life are quickly replaced
with an uncanny reality because of two striking interior features: the
impracticality of living in such a house and the fear someone is always watching
through the massive glass panes.</p>

<p>First, a glass house makes some aspects of daily life challenging. For one,
the house lacks privacy. The only enclosed rooms in the Farnsworth House are two
bathrooms found on each end of the wooden core.  A second concern is the lack of
storage space.  Most houses have closets and some have built in shelves.  The
Farnsworth House is different.  Aside from cabinets in the kitchen, storage
space lacks in this house.</p>

<p>The encompassing panes of glass exacerbates the issue.  Adding a piece of
furniture to store your stuff is not that easy when you live in a glass house.
You would be acutely aware of how a dresser, bookcase or any other piece of
furniture appears from both in and outside a house comprised of transparent
walls.  To this point Farnsworth laments, “Mies talks about ‘free space’: but
his space is very fixed . . . any arrangement of furniture becomes a major
problem because the house is transparent, like an X-ray.”<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>A house comprised of glass poses yet another problem: dealing with
temperature changes. The house was surprisingly well insulated, especially on a cool spring day.  The sun’s rays permeate through the glass panes on one side of the house, making it too warm to stay in one spot too long; the opposite side of the house was drastically cooler.  While a cool spring day is manageable, imagine trying to escape the heat and penetrating rays of sun during the summer months in a house with few window openings and no air conditioning, as Farnsworth experienced.</p>

<p>The livability of the Farnsworth House was problematized by Mies’s adherence
to modernist dictums. One was “less is more,” which refers to the simple
aesthetic of the house.  Anything more than the basic, unadorned forms making up
this house would take away from the surrounding outdoor splendor.  At the same
time, this approach would make decorating a burden.  Most items would seem out
of place in such an austere environment: imagine trying to hang a painting in a
glass house.  Even if you propped one up on an easel, the painting would likely
clash with the outside views.  The challenge of making a house a home is
probably why Farnsworth referred to her house as a “glass cage on stilts.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>A taxing reality</strong></p>

<p>The second striking issue of the Farnsworth House is the fear that someone is
watching you through the inescapable panes of glass.  It is a chilling sensation
even during the daylight hours.  Seeing body or furniture reflections in the
panes of glass during the day with a group of people on a tour is one thing.
Consider being by yourself in this house when nighttime comes&mdash;you cannot see
out, but voyeurs can look in.  The curtains that hang on from the nine-foot
glass panes would provide little relief, compared to plaster or drywall.  Farnsworth puts it best: “The truth is that in this house with its
four walls of glass I feel like a prowling animal, always on the
alert.”<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>Philip Johnson, who designed his own Glass House in 1949, included some of
the same attributes as the Farnsworth House; he knew of the house and openly
credited Mies for it.<sup>8</sup>  Yet, there is a critical addition to Johnson’s estate: a
brick house accompanies the glass one.  Originally built to include three guest
rooms, the Brick House was updated in 1953 to include a reading room and bedroom
with a connecting hallway.  The Brick House suggests the need for privacy and
the need to escape from a completely transparent life.  Johnson could turn to
his Brick House for a reprieve; Farnsworth could not.</p>

<p>Edith Farnsworth lived in her glass house for twenty years, after which she
sold it and moved to Italy.  Given the restlessness and anxiety the house
imposes, it is hard to fathom how she survived living in it for so long.  Now,
nearly a half of a century later, you too can experience a glass house life.
And the Farnsworth House is indeed an experience.  While you will undoubtedly
appreciate the Farnsworth House as a marvel of modern architecture, you will
also question what makes a house a home.</p>
