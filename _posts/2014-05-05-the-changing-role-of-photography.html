<p>A lot is happening in the world of photography.  The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art recently announced plans for a photography expansion.  As a result, the space devoted to photography will be doubled to include a print study center, an interpretive center to study photography’s historical and social roles and climate-controlled storage facilities.  The Centre Pompidou in Paris is also in the midst of a photography exhibition, focusing on Henri Cartier-Bresson.  This blockbuster exhibition, curated by Clement Cheroux, includes 500 images from family albums, portraits of the artist, drawings and paintings.  Yet, the Motion Photography Prize, which is currently on view at the Saatchi Gallery in London, is one of the most interesting events taking place in the world of photography.  This exhibition explores motion photography through smartphone technology and the Google+ application, resulting in a new art form.</p>

<p>The Saatchi Gallery, in conglomeration with Google+, an online social network, created the Motion Photography Prize as the first open global competition celebrating motion photography.  What once required special tools and information is now streamlined by Google+; this new technology enables users to automatically turn still photographs into motion photography.  The competition, which ran from 5 February through 1 April 2014, received over 4,000 applicants from 52 countries.  Submissions were placed into the six categories: landscape, lifestyle, action, people, night and urban.  The exhibition, presenting the finalists in each category and 54 shortlisted motion photographers, illustrates how smartphones and Google+ are two technologies changing the face of photography in the twenty-first century: capturing and sharing stories in a new, easier way.</p>

<p>Forbes estimates that more than 50 percent of American adults have smartphones, and according to CBS News, one billion people worldwide use one. Smartphones are having an impact on today’s art world, as illustrated by the Motion Photography Prize. First, smartphones make photography easy and accessible.  Having your phone means always having your camera.  Second, photography is a medium that society has become accustomed to and is familiar with.  By living in a world inundated with images, we are exposed to a vast amount of images from the internet, television and social media.  Constantly sorting through others’ images and adding our own to sites such as Facebook and Twitter demonstrate our understanding of this medium.  The ubiquitous use of smartphones and our constant exposure to images explains the rationale behind this prize and exhibition.</p>

<p>If the knowledge and technique of motion photography have been replaced with the smartphone and Google+, what does this mean for photography itself?  The CEO of Saatchi Gallery, Nigel Hurst, explains:</p> 

<blockquote>The [Saatchi] Gallery has been collaborating with Google since 2009 because of our joint aims of bringing new art, culture, and information to the widest possible audience and making it accessible dovetail so well.  Through the Motion Photography Prize, we hope to engage a new generation of photography enthusiasts and enable them to use Google+'s state-of-the-art technology to realize their visual ideas.</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Mr. Hurst’s statement, Saatchi’s partnership with Google+ and the competition itself point to a shift in photography in the twenty-first century towards an art form accessible for the masses.  Using a smartphone and Google+ to create motion photography not only quickly spreads one’s artwork to the world, but it also bypasses the challenges and knowledge previously needed to create this once difficult art form.  Therefore, perhaps photography today is about quantity: using technology to reach a large audience.</p>

<p>While the adage, “anyone can be an artist,” has always been true, this statement carries more weight today.  The advent of the smartphone and its corresponding technologies make photography increasingly accessible through innovative ways.  Smartphones may herald a new wave of photography in the twenty-first century.  But given the close ties between photography and technology, this medium will likely change in the future.  To anticipate the future of art, in addition to the art market truism that “art follows the money,” another phrase to remember is: “photography follows technology.”</p>
