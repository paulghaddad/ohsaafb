<p>“Before you please someone else, you first have to please yourself.”  A student expects to hear such words from a teacher, or an adult may receive this advice when trying to identify his or her passion in life.  This advice, however, comes from Tom Burckhardt, a New York-based artist known for his abstract paintings.  As someone who has followed his own advice, Mr. Burckhardt deviated from his work as a painter to create the installation piece that became <em>FULL STOP</em> (2004-2005).</p>

<p>The energy and vitality that filled Mr. Burckhardt as a young artist changed over time.  “I was feeling kind of frustrated with painting,” he explains in an interview with artist, Alexi Worth.  “Not really stuck; I just wasn’t enjoying it that much . . . I wanted to do something different.”  Instead of making another painting, Mr. Burckhardt created an installation with painting as its subject: <em>FULL STOP</em> is currently on show at the Columbus College of Art and Design.</p>

<p><em>FULL STOP</em> greets visitors with a life-size replica of an artist’s studio made entirely of cardboard and black paint.  Its contents, also made of cardboard, include a filled bookcase, cart with paints and brushes, desk, stove, window with a view of urban life and a bathroom. But the acute attention to detail makes this fictitious studio come alive.  Footprints and shoeprints of paint are on the floor; smudges and drips of paint denote the mixing of colors.  With the bathroom door ajar, open books on the desk and a pot on the stove near a Campbell’s soup can, it appears the artist stepped out for a moment.</p>

<p>Although viewers can revel in physical and intellectual attributes of the art process, <em>FULL STOP</em> also bespeaks of a larger metaphor: life.  The studio’s open doors are an invitation to literally step inside the space, and figuratively into the mind of an artist.  Consequently, visitors become voyeurs.  And a curious mind gives way to wandering eyes that examine the images of people and objects tacked above the desk, shelves of paint and countless books. Alongside painterly materials, tools&mdash;screw driver, tape measure, level and saw, among others&mdash;are hung neatly on the back wall.  Whose studio is this: a painter or sculptor?  Imaginations run wild trying to uncover this answer.</p>

<p>But this is not a particular artist’s studio, Mr. Burckhardt explains.  Nor is it his studio.  An amalgamation of personal and professional events culminate into what is <em>FULL STOP</em>: including leaving his work as an assistant for Red Grooms, becoming more autonomous and the passing of his father just a few years prior.  Indeed, this installation was the result of an artistic change that Tom Burckhardt desired.</p>

<p>“<em>FULL STOP</em>  was a hard left turn from the work I was doing as a painter,” Mr. Burckhardt explains.  Tellingly, a large, blank canvas&mdash;placed prominently on the easel in the middle of the studio&mdash;stares back at the viewer amidst this space of creativity.  The blank canvas represents the perfect storm: not knowing what to do next despite being equipped with the knowledge and tools, or unable to create due to a state of unfulfillment.  This critical moment is one that many can relate to, regardless of the profession.  Therefore, Mr. Burckhardt sees his installation as “a larger metaphor . . . it is not just about making art.”</p>

<p>The title alone&mdash;<em>FULL STOP</em>&mdash;does not predispose viewers to only think about this piece in terms of art.  It demonstrates Mr. Burckhardt's intention to relate art to life in general: the writer staring at a blank page suffering from “writer’s block”; the athlete whose performance time plateaus; the business owner who cannot get any more business from an existing client; or a young adult feeling stagnant in a career.  The frustration can be paralyzing, and it raises questions: What to do next?  And how will changes be received?  What if I don’t succeed?</p>

<p>Taking a risk and venturing into a new realm can bring upon lingering doubt, which is at the heart of <em>FULL STOP</em>.  “I am really interested in this idea of doubt, and that is what <em>FULL STOP</em> is all about,” Mr. Burckhardt explains.  Willing to diverge from past work is a critical decision for an artist, or anyone in a moment of transition.  There comes a choice to persevere or give up.  He speaks of his Calvinist work ethic, indicating his choice to press on: “I guess I am infused with that Calvinist ethic: get down to it and just do it,” he elaborated with Mr. Worth.  And he dispenses the mystical view sometimes associated with artists. “It is not a romantic thing, but like a job. You put in the hours, a commitment of ethics.”</p>

<p>The result of this perseverance has proven fruitful for Mr. Burckhardt, both in the reception of <em>FULL STOP</em> and the work that followed.  “I have taken ideas from <em>FULL STOP</em> to connect them back to being a painter again.  I can’t unlearn what I experienced.”  Consequently, some of the themes explored in <em>FULL STOP</em> appear in subsequent works; the works that make up <em>Slump</em> (2007-2008) are quintessential examples.  Bowing canvases that are supported by paint cans, crates and other objects tacitly ask viewers whether these works are paintings or sculptures.  Mr. Burckhardt’s current <em>New Paintings</em> continue this pursuit.  He looks towards contemporary art with humor: casting canvases plastic and blurring the line between painting and sculpture.</p>

<p>Edgar Degas said that “Art is not what you see, but what you make others see.”  Tom Burckhardt’s <em>FULL STOP</em> allows viewers to see and learn about art and life.  Some may relish in the privileged view of an artist’s studio.  Others may appreciate a studio hand-crafted from cardboard&mdash;an incredible feat, given its unyielding quality.  Still others may acknowledge the larger metaphor that applies to many: having all of the knowledge and surrounding materials, but staring at that all-encompassing “blank canvas.”  The hardest step sometimes is just starting, knowing that the process can help shape the future.</p>
