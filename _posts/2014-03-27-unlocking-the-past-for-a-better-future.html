<p>Confucius once said: &ldquo;<q>Study the past, if you would divine the future</q>.&rdquo;  Steve Sabella, a Berlin-based Palestinian artist, makes this quote come alive.  Mr. Sabella&rsquo;s first UK solo exhibition, <em>Fragments</em>, at the Berloni Gallery in London, England, demonstrates how coming to terms with the past creates a liberating future.  Born in Old Jerusalem in 1975, Mr. Sabella lay witness to political, cultural and religious unrest.  He describes experiences of alienation and dislocation not only from his home country, but also upon his move to London in 2007.  With photography as a primary means of expression, Mr. Sabella uses fragments to give visual form to his alienation, resulting in a new way to see and understand the past.</p>

<p>Of the four series that make up the <em>Fragments</em> installation, the two on the ground floor, <em>In Exile (2008)</em> and <em>Metamorphosis (2012)</em>, create a poetic juxtaposition that underscores the artist&rsquo;s mental journey.  <em>In Exile</em> consists of five large prints, each contain repetitive iterations of the same subject from different views: fragments are combined into a collage.  For example, one print reveals multiple iterations of windows superimposed with barbed wires; its black and blue colors create an eerie atmosphere.  Another consists of black and white images of a small child trying to open and close a window.  While the dark colors throughout this series, including blue, black, gray, add to the message of alienation, the window motif is a critical metaphor.  Mr. Sabella explains his exile as mental, not physical.  Although a window suggests hope, freedom or liberation, the dark colors and the chained or closed windows demonstrate the inability to escape.  Indeed, the mental turmoil of <em>In Exile</em> is reconfigured in <em>Metamorphosis</em>.</p>

<p>The parallel juxtaposition of <em>In Exile</em> and <em>Metamorphosis</em> generates a dialogue between Mr. Sabella&rsquo;s alienation and his attempt to overcome it.  He explores this process of change in <em>Metamorphosis</em>, which consists of seven prints, by examining personally charged symbols from multiple angles: concrete walls with exposed brick; barbed wire; among others.  In contrast to the <em>In Exile</em> series, only one of these images uses the closed window motif, but its context suggests a different message.  Instead of representing a dark mental turmoil, the image depicts a single cactus in a state of loneliness placed behind a closed window with yellow-colored architecture.</p>

<p>Although far from utopian, the way Mr. Sabella examines his subjects in <em>Metamorphosis</em> evokes a sense of liberation in two ways.  First, by confronting these charged symbols, Mr. Sabella demonstrates a willingness to move beyond the burden of the past&mdash;to see these objects anew in order to have a better future.  Keeping with the notion of repetition, Mr. Sabella&rsquo;s subjects are more intimately examined in <em>Metamorphosis</em>; each image is an amalgamation of closely studied objects.  For example, one image consists of barbed wire.  While Mr. Sabella explains the initial association with this object as a means to control movement, he also notes its reference to pain or stitching thread.  Indeed, it is not only the interpretation of a subject, but also its representation that is important.  Mr. Sabella elaborates:</p>

<blockquote>Notice how the wire appears to go in the space and out [of] it.  That idea is in conflict with its form and function&mdash;this is exactly the opposition I want to focus on in Metamorphosis.  It is the conflict between form and function, between visualization and perception.</blockquote> 

<p class="no-indent">Thus, this series examines the interchange among an object&rsquo;s function, symbolic association and personal significance, resulting in a new way to see the world.  Second, the title of the series, <em>Metamorphosis</em>, indicates change&mdash;a process&mdash;and not a fixed result.  Mr. Sabella states:</p>

<blockquote>The way I understand metamorphosis is that the rebirth will still remember or carry with it some burdens of the past, given that there is no DNA change.</blockquote>  

<p class="no-indent">While the past cannot be erased, it can be seen and understood from new angles.</p>

<p>The themes presented in <em>Fragments</em> are universally relevant: everyone has a past, and understanding that past&mdash;or coming to terms with it&mdash;can make for a better future.  Although change is not easy, it propels us towards a goal.  Mr. Sabella states:</p>

<blockquote>Change is the hardest thing to achieve in life.  We often stay the way we are, and we surrender to our surroundings. I nearly entrapped myself into my state of mind.  I feel it is time for me to unlock myself and shake my mental stagnation.</blockquote>  

<p class="no-indent">Despite a dark and personally difficult subject matter, Steve Sabella&rsquo;s <em>In Exile</em> and <em>Metamorphosis</em> create a beautiful juxtaposition: re-examining oneâ€™s past to have a better future.</p>

<cite>&ldquo;Fragments&rdquo; is on show at Berloni Gallery, 63 Margaret Street, London, W1W 8SW, until 10 May 2014.</cite>
