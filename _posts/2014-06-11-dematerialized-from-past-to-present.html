<p>The dematerialization theme is at the heart of the Miaz Brothers exhibition at Lazarides Rathbone, <em>Dematerialized: A New Contemporary Vision</em>.  The title of their series, <em>Antimatter</em>, reflects resistance towards the materiality of art. And the blurred images make the details virtually indistinguishable.  Consequently, the viewer plays a critical role: taking time to understand and decipher the message communicated visually, but perhaps more importantly, the ideas expressed intellectually.</p>

<p>After touring South America, Europe and Southeast Asia, Roberto and Renato Miaz, two Italian siblings, condensed their experiences in the <em>Antimatter</em> project.  New portraits from the <em>Antimatter</em> series fill this exhibition, including figures from the English Restoration, Japanese adolescents, philosophers, friends and lost ones.  Keeping the human subject central, spray paint not only addresses a human being’s philosophical complexities, but also the dematerialized theme.</p>

<p>“Dematerializing the lines,” the Miaz Brothers explain, “we gain a substantial indetermination of the picture.  This skips any immediate reaction and provokes the viewer to use mnemonic associations instead for their own personal visual information encoding.”  The detailed visual features that typically make up a portrait&mdash;facial expression, eye contact, symbolism, clothing&mdash;are eliminated.  Instead of relying on traditional pictorial cues to decipher an image, the viewer follows Ms. Lippard’s argument by spending more time experiencing less-detailed work.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Conventional art viewing is interrupted without distinct portrait details.  The consequences are two-fold.  First, the Miaz Brothers engage the viewer in a new way of looking, experiencing and understanding art and the contemporary world.  They elaborate: “We look to provide a visual experience that activates our awareness that compels the viewer to recognise and re-establish the limits of his or her own perception, to regain control of the real.”</p>

<p>The changed role of the viewer is the second way the traditional viewing experience is altered: from voyeur to subject.  The blurred aesthetic prevents viewers from peering into the private lives of the depicted.  Yet, situated in an environment of portraits, no matter how detailed, creates a sense of presence of being being looked at and communicated with.  Rather than telling the viewer what to think, the intentionally blurred image is a tactic: drawing awareness to new ways of visual, intellectual and experiential engagement.  <em>Lady C</em> is one such portrait; neither the title nor the image are explicit.  Recalling a faint memory or a photograph that fades over time, it is up to the viewer to create a story, narrative or personal meaning.  And thus, the portraits at Lazarides Rathbone are not about the visual image portrayed, but the idea that you, the viewer, project or experience.</p>

<p>Why is a concept explored so widely in the 1960s and 1970s used today?  The ubiquity of technology has turned society into one based on images.  The Miaz Brothers’s presentation of blurred portraits aims to slow down the twenty-first century viewer, who is constantly pressed for time and inundated with images.  Not readily revealing information, the <em>Antimatter</em> series asks viewers to slow down, look and think.  Thus, it appears that the Miaz Brothers look back in order to move forward: blending concepts from the past to derive a new way of looking, interpreting and experiencing contemporary life.  Because as Carl Sagan once said, “You have to know the past to understand the present.”</p>
