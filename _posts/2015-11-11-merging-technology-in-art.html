<p>It is no surprise that technology is infiltrating life today.  The internet and social media have had a revolutionary impact, but these technologies are just the beginning of what is to come.  The debut of self-driving cars, the Internet of Things and improvements to virtual reality have the potential to upend life as we know it.  Indeed our digital and physical worlds are colliding.</p>

<p>The “Feel Flows” exhibition at Fernwey gallery in Chicago captures this merge.  The show consists of Katie Pennachio’s paintings and Matt Mancini’s sculptures, along with an edition series each artist made in collaboration with the gallery in a different medium.  Despite the physical presence of their artwork, a digital aesthetic emanates.  Both artists incorporate digital technologies in their practices, and their influence is demonstrated here.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>One of the joys of the show is seeing Pennachio’s contributions.  At first glance her paintings, largely consisting of geometric shapes and rising and falling lines, imply a visual rendition of data transmission; the paintings’ titles, such as “screen[1510]” or “screen[1502],” add to this computational theme.  More still, the repeated thin, precise lines from afar have the appearance of a digital rendering.</p>

<p>These are reasonable observations, since Pennachio also makes “digital drawings,” as the artist calls them, which are separate from the paintings themselves.  “[The digital drawings] are related,” she says, “but there is no direct lineage from one to another.  I made many of the [digital] drawings after the paintings in the show.”  Even still, her relationship with the digital emanates throughout the show.  In fact, her edition series consists of “Digital Artist Book:” a custom-designed USB that includes 37 of her “digital drawings.”  In this way, her sketches could appear as digital artworks on computers or televisions.</p>

<p>But everything changes up close.  Details manifest, exposing the hand of the artist: lines vary in thickness and exactness, and brushstrokes become apparent.  Take “screen[1512].”  Moving near, the subtle white brushstrokes sweeping throughout the canvas become apparent.  It is here, too, where art historical relationships abound.  The familiarity of repeated lines imply connections to Minimalist and Conceptual artists.</p>

<p>Pennachio’s works are juxtaposed with Mancini’s two sculptures; thus providing visual variance for the viewer, while also revealing the digital and physical convergence through a different medium.  Mancini explains that he often uses Rhino, a 3D modeling program, to make sculptures, prints and paintings before creating their physical variant.  Since both artists incorporate digital technologies in their practice, the question is: what does the digital offer that the physical does not?</p>

<p>Pennachio says her digital work is a “strange escape from material concerns.”  Mancini 
finds working in the digital realm a similarly liberating experience.  “Drawing in an uninhibited digital space . . . allows me realize my sculptures and paintings without friction and gives me freedom to create really alien looking work that I don't think I could have rendered by hand,” he acknowledges.  In a different age, Pennachio’s paintings and Mancini’s sculptures may convey different impressions.  But in one that is becoming increasingly digital, their work suggests a relevant tension through the lens of art.</p>
