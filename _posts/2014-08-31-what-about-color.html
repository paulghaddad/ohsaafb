<p>Giovanni Bellini, Mark Rothko, Dan Flavin and James Turrell are seemingly disparate artists that share one critical factor: the use of colour, albeit through different means.  Colour does more than liven a painting, create an illusion or evoke an emotional reaction.  It bespeaks of another life: the influence of trade, science or technology on a work of art.</p>

<p>Venice, for instance, was known as the city of colour during the Renaissance.  Its location proved central to its reputation.  Art greats such as Giovanni Bellini and Titian captured the range of colors and hues reflecting on the nearby sea.  Venice also became a trade center due to its locale.  Its access to foreign goods, including azurite, vermilion and orpiment, resulted in many imported colors, the National Gallery of Art explains.</p> 

<p>But the Renaissance was hundreds of years ago.  Appreciation for colour, and its once laborious process, can be lost or forgotten in the 21st century: technology takes precedence, and streamlines the colour-making technique.  Therefore, London’s National Gallery current exhibition, <em>Making Colour</em>, debuts at a good time.  Although specific towards the origins and making of colour from the early Renaissance to the Impressionist movement, the exhibition sparks a larger conversation about colour: its use in various art genres today.</p>

<p><em>Making Colour</em> unveils how colours, including blue, green, yellow and red, among others, are derived from the displayed minerals.  And the accompanying videos demonstrate the colour making process&mdash;one that is just as much a science as an art.  Colour wheels are juxtaposed with paintings; colour theorists, such as Isaac Newton, are recognized.  Understanding the science allows for a better understanding of the art, a concept made most apparent with the Impressionists. </p>

<p>Impressionism manifests colour in modern terms.  “Without paint in tubes,” Renoir once argued, “there would have been no Cézanne, no Monet, no Sisley or Pissarro.”  Access to this “readymade” paint, as the National Gallery termed it, made the painting process quicker and easier than hand mixed paint.  It also paralleled the Impressionists’ haphazard technique and intent: quick brushstrokes of paint capturing fleeting moments of modern life.  Claude Monet’s <em>Gare St. Lazare</em> (1877) reveals these very ideas.  He captures the image that strikes the eye, an image of a Parisian train station in this instance, using colour to capture the immediacy of everyday life.</p>

<p><em>Making Colour</em> ends with Impressionism.  But this movement is just the beginning of the colour conversation, as subsequent ones are implicitly called to mind.  The advancement of colour over time marks a change of emphasis from the <em>making</em> of colour towards <em>using</em> color, particularly during the later part of the 20th century and into the 21st.</p>

<p>Take the Post-Impressionist artist, Georges Seurat.  His Pointillism technique stressed the scientific breakdown of colour perception: evenly distributed, non-expressional dots of colour.  His <em>La Grande Jatte</em> is a quintessential example.  He believed the spectator’s eye would create color gradations with the dots, resulting in an optical fusion.</p>

<p>Jackson Pollock’s “drip paintings” further demonstrate the use of colour.  He dripped, splattered and looped paint across a canvas lying on the floor, which comprised his <em>One: Number 31</em> (1950).  The outcome is a sensation for the viewer, using paint to make expressive gestures.  The eye follows the drips of paint: traveling in, out and across the canvas.  What is more, Mark Rothko saw the emotional use of colour, as underscored in his <em>No. 2</em> (1963).  “I am interested in expressing the big emotions&mdash;tragedy, ecstasy, doom,” Rothko once said. </p> 

<p>Perhaps most telling is James Turrell’s interest in optics and perception.  His <em>Pullen (Red)</em> (1968), which is currently on display at London’s Blain Southern, uses light and space to create what appears to be a three-dimensional red triangle.  But colour is not the goal.  “It’s about perception,” Mr. Turrell responded when asked about his work.  “For me, it’s using light as a material to influence or affect the medium of perception.”  Bridget Riley also shares an interest in perception.  Her repetition of stripes denotes the movement and optical sensations that can occur in the spectator’s eye.</p>

<p>While the history of colour and its making are interesting, why is it relevant today?  First, <em>Making Colour</em> asks viewers to look, experience and understand the making of colour: noting its labor and influences.  Consequently, viewers also think about <em>how</em> color is used today in the 21st century.  Second, this exhibition looks outside the realm of art itself.  The materials used to make colour hundreds of years ago resulted from trade and science.  And a similar parallel is seen in the colour used today.  Tubes of paint have replaced hand mixed paint, and technological advancements have expedited the color making process even more.  Now with a few clicks of a mouse, colours can be easily manipulated and images transformed, thanks to software such as Photoshop.</p>

<p>Accounting for the making of colour through the history of art would be a monumental task.  Artists have explored and experimented with intensities of colour throughout the centuries: from Peter Paul Rubens to Henri Matisse and beyond.  Artists have also greatly reduced or eliminated color; minimalist artists, including Donald Judd and Robert Morris, are two examples.  Instead of creating artworks for visceral delectation, they reduced the details of the artwork. These artists emphasized the encounter with the artwork and its surrounding environment by making a situation for the viewer.  Since artists have explored colour in both its presence and absence throughout time, where this exhibition leaves off, modern and contemporary artists and exhibitions pick up&mdash;leaving it up to visitors to contemplate how colour is used, or not used, today.</p>
