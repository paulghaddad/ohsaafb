<p class=no-indent><em>“What makes Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley?” is a worthy question for the art world to consider.</em></p>

<p>It has been said that art follows the money.  And so it seems, given the art world’s interest in Silicon Valley.  The technology industry that makes up this eminent region has made many software engineers, programmers and entrepreneurs very wealthy.  Now the art world wants to share in this success.  Notably, Christie’s auction house partnered with Passerelle Investments in the fall of 2014.  The auction house sent a group of artworks to Silicon Valley that were later offered at auction in New York.  “The goal of the show is the continuing effort to attract tech money to the art market,” explains a 2014 Art Market Monitor article.  Christie’s is not alone.  Two art fairs, Silicon Valley Contemporary (SVC) and Art Silicon Valley/San Francisco, also debuted in 2014.  Both featured technology-based artwork&mdash;a reasonable decision for a renowned technology hub.</p>

<p>The type of art may only be one aspect to consider when trying to appeal to those that make up Silicon Valley’s technology sector.  A 2014 San Francisco Chronicle article notes that SVC had a great turnout, but a dismal number of buyers.  Perhaps <em>how</em> art is displayed may also be worth considering.  After all, this is Silicon Valley&mdash;there is no place like it, despite those who have tried to replicate its success.  Incorporating some of Silicon Valley’s attributes into the display of art could help the art world achieve its aim.</p>

<p>What makes Silicon Valley unique?  Answers vary, but many point to the region’s culture.  Frederick Terman, an academic, came to Silicon Valley nearly a century ago and established a network-based model that still exists today.  According to the book, “Silicon Valley," this model emphasizes collaboration, collective learning and teamwork between academia and industry. Terman produced “a culture of cooperation and information exchange,” as a MIT Technology Review article, “Silicon Valley Can’t be Copied,” puts it.  These traits, along with Silicon Valley’s inclination towards experimentation, risk and innovation, help make Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley. To attract the likes of those in the region, does it not make sense to incorporate some of Silicon Valley’s cultural themes into the display of art?</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Zero1, an organization in San Jose, California, appears to think so.  It describes itself as “the art and technology network.”  The network methodology and vision to “provoke new ideas, spark experimentation and seed creative strategies today” coincide with Silicon Valley itself.  In short, Zero1 caters towards a Silicon Valley audience.  The exhibition space, Zero1 Garage exemplifies this point.  Take its title: “Zero1” points to zeros and ones&mdash;the binary numbers and bits that underlie technology; “Garage” references Hewlett Packard’s and Apple’s humble beginnings in Silicon Valley.  More telling is the configuration of art in the Zero1 Garage.  This distinguishing quality marks a deliberate departure from the traditional white cube gallery approach, as demonstrated by the 2012 Zero1 Biennial, which took place in the Zero1 Garage (the next Zero1 Biennial is in 2016).</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>Paving a new way</strong></p>

<p>“We believe that artists are the ultimate provocateurs, experimenters and risk-takers,” Joel Slayton, executive director at Zero1, states in a video about the organization.  These words not only reflect the type of art shown at the 2012 Zero1 Biennial, but also reveal how the art was displayed.  Christopher Haas, a San Francisco architect, created a “nonclassical display” at the 2012 biennial to “evoke in visitors a sense of wonder, play and discovery,” the Zero1 website notes.  This critical deviation from the white cube approach brings Silicon Valley’s intrinsic qualities into the display of art.  That is to say, the configuration of art fosters the collaborative, interactive and network qualities found in the region.</p>

<p>Take Christopher Baker’s <em>Murmur Study</em> displayed at the 2012 Zero1 Biennial.  This installation aimed to investigate the increase of micro-messaging technologies, such as status updates for Twitter and Facebook.  Thermal receipt printers, found high overhead, monitored Twitter for messages with emotional utterances; deviations on words such as “argh,” “meh,” “grrrr,” “oooo,” “ewww,” and “hmph” were then printed on receipt paper and streamed into the gallery space for visitors to read.  Furthermore, <em>Murmur Study’s</em> display added to the visitor’s engagement.  Instead of being secluded in a corner or against a wall, the installation was in open space: visitors could see and approach the piece from multiple angles and directions.  This is critical.  The exhibition space became a journey for visitors to take unexpected routes and have glances of neighboring art objects, the Zero1 website describes.  “These glimpses pique our curiosities and draw us deeper into investigation and a desire to discover what things lie ahead.”  The display environment allowed a journey of discovery to happen.</p>

<p>Other art institutions are catching on.  The upcoming opening of the Hauser Wirth &amp; Schimmel campus in Los Angeles suggests the integration of similar ideas.  Paul Schimmel, vice president and partner in Hauser &amp; Wirth and cofounder of Hauser &amp; Wirth &amp; Schimmel in LA, notes in a 2015 art ltd. magazine article that some artists do well in a white cube and others do not.  He also realizes the gallery’s role to educate and engage the public.  More than just housing exhibitions, this space will offer “a place to come and sit, with a garden, a courtyard, a restaurant, a bookshop,” Mr. Schimmel reveals.  “We want this to be the living room for the downtown arts community.”  The parallels between Hauser &amp; Wirth &amp; Schimmel and Zero1 reside in customizing towards the needs of the artists and audience, and adapting to both.</p>

<p>Exhibitions have certainly deviated from the white cube model in the past.  Displaying art in a white cube is still a common way to exhibit art, as it’s been for decades.  Departing from this approach is relevant for Silicon Valley as an emerging art market.  Indeed, Silicon Valley is more than a hub that develops tangible hardware products, such as Apple’s iPhone or iWatch; it also creates software&mdash;the code that runs these products.  Working in tandem, hardware and software produce information for its users and connect people to the world at large.  Many of Silicon Valley’s industries integrate its cultural qualities.  Brian Chesky, one of the founders of the San Francisco company, Airbnb, described his business in a 2014 New York Times article as “[a] community marketplace that connects people through unique spaces around the world.”  To reap success in Silicon Valley, the art world should follow a similar approach: not only focusing on the tangible art object, but also its display which ultimately generates information and ideas, much like the region itself.</p>
