<p class=no-indent><em>The Art Institute of Chicago explores James Ensor’s iconic artwork.</em></p>

<p>“Before the compositions I feel anxious and exalted,” Douglas Druick, director at the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC), quotes Belgian artist, James Ensor in 1887.  These words aptly apply to Ensor’s work from 1880 through 1890.  His career began in a conventional, natural style.  By the 1880s, his work became increasingly sardonic, bizarre and jarring at times.  Ensor is perhaps best remembered for anticipating Fauvism and becoming a precursor to German Expressionism.</p>

<p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago charts James Ensor’s artistic path during an important decade from 1880 to 1890.  <em>The Temptation of Saint Anthony</em> (1887) is the centerpiece of AIC’s exhibition, <em>Temptation: The Demons of James Ensor</em>.  On view are a variety of works by Ensor, including oils, charcoals, inks, drawings and etchings.  The story evolves throughout the exhibition’s eight rooms, starting with Ensor’s oil paintings in the years leading up to and following <em>The Temptation of Saint Anthony</em>.  These images not only reveal Ensor’s interest in light, color and experimentation.  But they also denote recurring subjects: skeletons, masks and grotesque carnival scenes.</p>

<p><em>The Temptation of Saint Anthony</em> includes some of the same themes.  It consists of 51 separate sheets of paper; the images were then pasted together, resulting in the almost six foot tall final image.  The title refers to the fourth century saint who became a hermit: resisting corruption through faith.  This familiar story in art was reinvigorated in the 19th century by Gustave Flaubert’s literary version.  Ensor’s iteration is a drawing depicting the saint surrounded with religious and modern images.  The dizzying amount of detail brings together individual narratives, indicative of Ensor’s private and public concerns, into one unifying whole.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Except for the few years he studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels, James Ensor resided in Ostend, Belgium his whole life.  Much of his imagery derived inspiration from the seaside port of Ostend, contemporary middle class interiors and Japanese prints sold in his parent’s souvenir shop.  He also channeled his disturbed mental state, brought on by the death of his father and personal ailments, into art.  In this way, his art seemingly paralleled the anxiety and troubles in his life; the rapid brushstrokes of paint, death-related symbols and peculiar figures point to this.</p>

<p>AIC’s decision to focus the exhibition on <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em> helps clarify Ensor’s themes during a prolific artistic period.  Viewers implicitly compare and contrast his iconic image with those made before and after, both in terms of style and content.  <em>Adam and Eve expelled from Paradise</em> (1887) and <em>Fall of the Revel Angels</em> (1889) underscore Ensor’s turn towards religion; the skeleton motif, a reference to death after the loss of his father, is reflected in <em>Skeleton Painting</em> (circa 1896); and Ensor’s interest in Japanese prints, depicting demons and ghosts, is similarly reflected in his inclusion of beasts and creatures.  These motifs culminate in his highly acclaimed piece.</p>

<p>It is fascinating to delve into the details and uncover the narratives of <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em> after seeing Ensor’s influences.  From afar, the piece appears to be a large image of the traditional religious figure, St. Anthony.  Upon closer examination, viewers delight in the many personal and religious anecdotes.  Hidden within is a man and a fish that refers to Ostend’s seaport; figures with swollen bellies and sores reference disease and decay; and a Christ figure wears a Belgian military hat.  Indeed, the many pieces of Ensor’s oeuvre that make up this exhibition are a prelude to discovering and understanding <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em>&mdash;the capstone of this show.</p>

<p>The Art Institute of Chicago is a suitable location for Ensor’s seminal piece.  First, conservation work began on <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em> after AIC acquired it in 2006. Second, AIC is home to Georges Seurat’s <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte</em> (1884).  This is important, Mr. Druick argues, because Ensor wanted to rival Seurat’s image by creating a large drawing: <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony.</em></p>

<p>James Ensor’s creativity declined at the turn of the 20th century, at the same time he began to receive praise and admiration.  And the recognition continues today.  The Art Institute of Chicago displays a captivating show of an important Belgian avant-garde artist whose legacy lives on in future art movements.  Be sure to see it.</p>
