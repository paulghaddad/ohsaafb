# Hello world

As a student, seeing a slide of Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn’s “The Night
Watch” paled compared to seeing it several years later at the Rijksmuseum in
Amsterdam. As I would come to find out, a projected slide didn’t capture the
greatness of this painting. It has to be seen and experienced in person to be
fully appreciated.

“The Night Watch” is stunning in person. The painting commands your attention by size
alone. At nearly 12 feet wide and over 14 feet tall, it dwarfs the swarm of
visitors flocking to it. You feel small and insignificant compared to the
portrait of a militia company in front of you. In other words, this painting has
presence. But it’s Rembrandt's use of light that’s most arresting. Etched in my
memory are the two brilliantly lit figures&mdash;a young girl and lieutenant with
elegant embroidered details on their clothing&mdash;in what is otherwise a dark scene. You can’t help but stop and stare.

One of life’s pleasure is physically seeing an artwork. For me, it’s not just
about seeing a painting I’ve studied. It’s about the entire experience of
getting there and sharing the opportunity with friends or other gallery goers.
However, virtual reality (VR) poses an interesting challenge for viewing art
today. Some say there’s no need to go to a museum or gallery when you can don a
VR headset and see paintings, sculptures, and photographs virtually in the
comfort of your own home. I take a different view: VR won’t replace physical art
institutions, but VR will affect them.

## Getting there is part of the fun

People pony up good money each year to travel to the Louvre in Paris to see
Leonardo Da Vinci's “Mona Lisa” and the Accademia in Florence to see
Michelangelo’s “David.” These artworks reside in cities filled with tasty
cuisines, fascinating histories, and delightful cultures, giving tourists many
incentives to make the trip.
