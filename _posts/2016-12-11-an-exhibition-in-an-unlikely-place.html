<p>Unless you’re looking for Matt Nichols’s exhibition, “SomethingDivine,” you
may miss it. On the DePaul Art Museum’s second floor, three restrooms&mdash;men’s,
women’s, and unisex&mdash;designed for individual use contain an array of white,
hand-carved soaps and embroidered hand towels. The soaps are mundane with
simple designs. What the soaps lack in aesthetic value, they more than make up
in the questions they pose. Because you are in an art museum, you cannot help
but wonder if these utilitarian objects are works of art. If they are art, how
should you interact with them?</p>

<p>The first question is answered by the museum label. It provides the typical
details you’d expect, including the name of the artist, artwork title, year made
and medium. As for the second question, there’s no direction how or if you
should use the soaps and towels. However, the causal display of objects with
inherent use-value inside a private space baits you to pick up a piece of soap
and use it. You’ve got the freedom to interact with and enjoy art, without
expectations or watchful eyes of a security guard. As such, visitors have taken
the liberty to use the towels, which are tousled on the shelf, and soaps&mdash;some of
which are broken or misshapen from use. </p>

<p>Each of the three restrooms offers a similar setup: a handful of soaps line
the sink counter; several more hang from white ropes under a shelf next to the
sink with embroidered hand-towels on top. Indeed, blurring the line between art
and function is at the heart of this fascinating show. As the artist puts it,
“My hope was that the soap would be used and essentially lose its "Art"
value/nature as it assumed its utilitarian role.”</p>

<p>The designs of the soaps vary. They include “culturally iconic art works,
popular tropes [and] personal symbols,” describes Nichols. Many keep with
traditional gender stereotypes, which are further emphasized by their respective
placement in the restrooms. The women’s restroom includes a piece of soap
resembling the Venus of Willendorf, a symbol of fertility, and a tube of
lipstick. Identifying the various designs is fun and draws you in initially, but
the heightened awareness of the handwashing experience keeps you lingering.</p>

<p>Handwashing is a habitual part of your routine that requires little thought.
But not here. You are littered with choices. You decide whether or not to use
the liquid soap and paper towels provided by the museum or one or more of
Nichols’s soaps and embroidered towels. The options draw attention to this daily
ritual. In other words, handwashing becomes a conscious act. This seems to be
the point, because now you begin thinking about the larger meaning of this work.</p>

<p>The show’s title, “SomethingDivine,” suggests a religious connotation, since cleansing acts
or purification rituals are part of many religions, including Hinduism, Judaism
and Christianity. The Christian practice of Baptism is an act of purification
granting entrance into the Christian Church; it usually involves submersing or
pouring water on the person being baptized. "Ideas surrounding ritual,
specifically cleansing, and inherent art value were a cornerstone for my point
of departure," the artist says.</p>

<p>Ritualistic practices also apply to art museums. Art historian Carol Duncan
explains in her book, “Civilizing Rituals,” how art museums operate as ritual
sites: “Like most ritual space, museum space is carefully marked off and
culturally designated as reserved for a special quality of attention&mdash;in this
case, for contemplation and learning.” She adds how museums also have behavioral
expectations associated with ritualistic activity&mdash;don’t do this, or don’t do
that. However, art museum rituals take on a new meaning in this show.</p>

<p>In “SomethingDivine,” it’s up to the visitor to determine how to use the
objects and act in the space. For some, the soaps and towels are simply an
alternative to the handwashing materials provided by the museum. For others,
this exhibition is about the experience the objects evoke. You decide whether to
treat the soaps like sculptures, admiring them from afar, or to interact with
them like a one-person performance. And so the soaps don't lose their “Art” value
as the artist hoped. Rather they get you thinking about art, rituals and
expectations in new ways.</p>

<p>“SomethingDivine” makes you feel uncomfortable at first, mostly because of
its unconventional environment. You expect to see art in a gallery, art fair or
the living areas of someone’s home. You expect to see art formally displayed,
such as a sculpture on a plinth or a painting framed and hung on a wall. Nichols
upends traditional art expectations by placing art in an unlikely place: a
public museum’s restroom. This jarring environment is useful. It stops you in
your tracks and does what art is supposed to do: it engages you and makes you
think. It also raises questions without providing answers. Chief among them is
the age old question: what is art? It’s up to you to decide.</p>

<cite>“SomethingDivine” is on show at the DePaul Art Museum until December 18, 2016.<a
