<p>The start of September marked the beginning of a busy fall season for arts and culture in Chicago.  Alongside a host of museum and gallery exhibition openings, EXPO Chicago, an international modern and contemporary art fair, recently concluded.  And the Chicago Architecture Biennial just opened on October 3.  Among these cultural happenings included this year’s One State Together in the Arts conference, a biennial event since 1999 that claims to be the only “statewide, multidisciplinary conference for arts leaders and practitioners in Illinois.”</p>

<p>One State is an opportunity for creative and art professionals from around Illinois to network, gain insights and identify resources.  In 2013, the One State conference revealed how creativity in the arts can transform communities and solve collective problems; the 2011 conference featured topics on breakthrough ideas, people and connections.  This year’s theme was “flourish.”  Over the course of two days, over a dozen presenters discussed using creative activity to encourage individual, communal and global change.  More than motivational speak, this conference gave concrete examples and personal accounts of how to make a difference in the arts, no matter how big or small.</p>

<p>“If art is such a good thing, shouldn’t we have more of it?” asked Cheryl Lynn Bruce, an actor, writer and director, in a thoughtful keynote address with visual artist Kerry James Marshall.  The benefits of the arts are vast, from revitalizing neighborhoods to fostering innovation, but action is needed in order for the arts to flourish.  This includes speaking up at a PTA meeting or church event, Bruce suggested, or fostering educational changes to stimulate the minds and imaginations of today’s youth.  “The onus is on us to cultivate, to broadly teach and encourage young minds.”</p>

<p>Taking action, whether mental or physical, was a major theme of the conference.  When it comes to budget concerns in the arts, for example, Coya Paz, a writer and director, implied a change of attitude is needed.  “We operate on the scarcity model or we operate on this model that somebody is coming to save us," Paz explained during a breakout session, "and in reality nobody is . . .  we already have everything we need to sustain ourselves and to flourish.”  She has a point.  “Rethink[ing] how we are working” may open minds to new options and ideas, ones that can encourage progress.</p>

<p>By way of contrast, artist and professor Michael Rakowitz demonstrated the societal impact of his artwork during a riveting presentation.  Consider his project “paraSITE:” an ongoing series of inflatable shelters custom built for homeless people.  Although the shelters are a “bandage” on a situation, the artist acknowledged, they serve a dual purpose: providing brief comfort to those in need and drawing attention to the problem that needs a long-term solution.</p>

<p>The quaint college town of Evanston, about 15 miles from Chicago and home to
Northwestern University, was an apt location for this year’s conference given
its theme&mdash;revealing how art can thrive in smaller communities, like
Evanston, or in the blossoming art scene in downtown Chicago.  It’s an idea made clear through tours offered of Evanston's small businesses, community organizations and historical and downtown buildings.  Extending beyond the conference hall walls and into other art spaces demonstrated the many ways the arts are flourishing.</p>

<p>Cheryl Lynn Bruce explained that “art can only empower us if we create spaces for it in our communities and in our lives.”  This year's speakers gave ample examples of creating space for art.  Hearing and seeing how professionals embrace the arts in a variety of ways revealed that everyone has a role, implicitly prompting the question: what are you doing to fulfill it?  To that end, attendees were unequivocally encouraged to take action and make a difference.</p>
