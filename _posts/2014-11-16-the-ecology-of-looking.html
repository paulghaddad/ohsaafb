<p class=no-indent><em>Jacob Leveton curates a captivating art exhibition that brings ecological issues into the confines of the museum.</em></p>

<p>Pollution, global warming and drilling for oil are just three ecological concerns facing the world today.  These issues, and the industries they emanate from, are not only damaging the environment.  They are also producing negative implications for humanity.  The Deepwater Horizon Spill, caused by BP in 2010, killed eleven people and dumped over 200 million gallons of oil into the ocean and Gulf coastlines.  The May 2014 fire that erupted in a Soma, Turkey, mine claimed the lives of 301 people.  And most recently, the exploitation of oil sands, particularly in Canada, is harming wildlife, air and water quality.  Given the issues facing us, engaging with the environment through art is one way to generate awareness and solicit activism.</p>
 
<p>Artists have been grappling with environmental issues for decades.  In 1982, Agnes Denes famously created <em>Wheatfield</em>.  An artwork consisting of 1,000 pounds of wheat in the middle of New York City, it “call[ed] attention to our misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values.”  More recently, Olafur Eliasson, in collaboration with geologist Minik Rosing, debuted <em>Ice Watch</em> (2014); 112 tons of ice were brought from Greenland to Copenhagen's City Hall Square to represent climate change.  But artists are not alone.  Curators are also confronting ecological concerns through art exhibitions.  These issues are at the center of the exhibition, <em>Ecological Looking: Sustainability &amp; the End(s) of the Earth</em>, at the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art.</p>

<p>This exhibition features images from the 19th and 20th centuries that tell a compelling story: it raises critical questions about the impact of industrial practices on the Earth.  The curator, Jacob Leveton, a Northwestern Ph.D. student, compiled images from different media into a single gallery space to represent various ways the Earth’s resources are used: through agriculture, mining, oil extraction and refining.  “[By] bringing science [in] dialogue with art as a shared space of commitment . . . art becomes a springboard for these conversations,” Mr. Leveton explains.  In this way, he purposely departs from the artists’ intentions to generate a modern narrative about the possible repercussions on the Earth’s natural resources.</p> 

<p>The story unfolds with early images of mining and industry.  Take David Burke’s colored woodcut, <em>Coal Mining</em> (1935).  As a Works Progress Administration artist, Burke’s image celebrates the worker in order to restore confidence in the American people after the Great Depression.  Images of mining and industry were once seen as positive: representing employment following an economic calamity.  But to a contemporary eye, this image takes on new meanings.</p>

<p>Environmental damage from mining is one way to see Burke’s image today; a macro level view of the situation calling attention to industry itself is another.  “Ecology allows us to engage with labor practices that are problematic and fraught,” Mr. Leveton offers.  The <em>Premier Mine, Wesselton</em> photographs (1890-1899) are quintessential examples.  Images depicting earthly ruins from a diamond extraction operation in South Africa indicate the dangerous conditions associated with the work itself: collapses, fires and deaths.</p> 
 
<p>These early images are juxtaposed with later ones suggesting the consequences of industry 
on the environment.  Theo Leffman’s <em>Rainforest I</em> (1993) is a reminder of this very fact.  According to National Geographic, 14 percent of the Earth’s land was once covered in rainforests&mdash;a number that has shrunk to six percent.  The demand for timber and land from the paper, cattle and energy industries are just three of the many threats facing rainforests today.  Indeed, the exhibition implicitly draws a parallel between industry and environment, both past and present.</p>

<p>Despite using art to engage with ecological issues, this exhibition does not stray from its art historical and theoretical roots.  The images are surrounded by quotes from key writers and thinkers&mdash;Matthew Huber, William Blake and Cameron Scott&mdash;that underpin this exhibition.  Combining images and text gives weight to the issues explored.  But ultimately it is up to visitors to reflect on ecological concerns in the 21st century.</p>
 
<p><em>Ecological Looking: Sustainability &amp; the End(s) of the Earth</em> aims to draw awareness about industrial practices and their ecological impact, yet it does much more.  “[The] exhibition has exceeded expectations, generating public interest on campus and beyond,” Mr. Leveton explained when asked about the response to his show.  The exhibition’s positive reception has inspired him to think more broadly about his work in art history and as a curator: “Art can be a force of social change, a catalyst for social transformation.”  The Twitter hashtag for this exhibition (#EcoLooking) reveals his interest to continue the ecological conversation outside the confines of the gallery&mdash;doing his part to generate awareness, conversation and activism surrounding ecological issues.</p>
