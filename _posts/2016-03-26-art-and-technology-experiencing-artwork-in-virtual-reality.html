<p>In February the Stolbun Collection debuted the Digital Museum of Digital Art
(DiMoDA), an installation and “virtual institution” dedicated to digital art.
By wearing the Oculus Rift headset visitors see and experience exhibitions by
artists Claudia Hart, Tim Berresheim, Jacolby Satterwhite and Aquanet 2001 in
virtual reality (VR).</p>

<p>There is a lot of hype around VR.  Revolutionary and transformative claims
are commonplace.  
DiMoDA builds on the excitement: it is an opportunity for the general public to
try the much talked about headset and experience VR in the realm of art.
Experiencing art in VR is both normal and bizarre.  Artists incorporating the
latest technology in art is not new.  In contrast to video or photography,
however, you wear the medium and control the degree of engagement with VR.</p>


<p>Many trace VR’s origins back to the 1930s with Stanley G. Weinbaum’s science
fiction story, “Pygmalion’s Spectacles.”  A few decades later the bulky headsets
and rudimentary graphics from the 1980s and 1990s never took off.  Fast-forward
to the 21st century and Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, provided an
alternative with the Oculus Rift: a VR headset that is smaller, sleeker and full
of potential.  Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014, and the enthusiasm has only
intensified.  Google Cardboard, a low-cost VR viewer, paired up with The New
York Times (NYT) last fall: providing subscribers to the NYT’s Sunday print
edition with the cardboard set.  The cardboard viewer is a cheap way for the
masses to try VR, and the idea has taken off.  Even McDonald’s is catching on.

              reports</a> that McDonald’s Sweden rolled out a limited initiative earlier
this month called “Happy Goggles,” where Happy Meal boxes can be turned into a
VR headset.</p>

<p>Given the popularity of VR today, it makes sense that artists and art
institutions are experimenting with it.  Artist Gretchen Andrew debuted a VR
exhibition in 2015 at De Re Gallery in Los Angeles, appropriately titled
“Alternate Reality.”  Visitors wore VR headsets to view and learn about Andrew’s
paintings.  Notably, too, The Courtauld Gallery in London teamed up with
WoofbertVR, a creator of immersive art educational content.  After downloading
the WoofbertVR app and wearing a Samsung Gear VR headset, visitors will see the
museum’s Wolfson room and hear a narration discussing the artwork,

<p>A large LED screen hangs on an adjacent wall at the Stolbun Collection.
Other visitors can see the Rift user navigate through the virtual museum.
Watching the installation on a screen is quite different than experiencing it in
a 3D environment.  After donning the VR headset, you transport into this other
world: from downtown Chicago to a fictitious, animated space.  Turn your head
up, down or to either side&mdash;you are completely immersed.  New ways of interacting
with artwork are also exciting.  Move near, far or on an object; view it from
multiple perspectives; listen to the accompanying soundtrack.  The result is not
only a multi-sensorial experience, but also one that upends the passive user to
an active user.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>VR’s opportunities and challenges</strong></p>

<p>DiMoDA’s basic graphics and occasional time-lapses are overshadowed by VR's potential.  Indeed, the benefits of this medium abound.  The Stolbun
Collection’s location denotes one: the opportunity to look at artwork by several
artists in a small environment; thereby reducing the need for a large, and often
expensive, gallery space.  A second advantage is showing multiple art
exhibitions at once, as De Re Gallery did when Andrew’s debuted her show last
year.  Third, shipping costs may be abated, since artwork is accessed virtually.
Above all, VR could also make art more accessible to people around the world, as
the partnership between WoofbertVR and The Courtauld Gallery suggest.</p>

<p>VR has its trouble spots.  After few minutes in this virtual world, the much
talked about side-effect sets in: nausea.  Although not everyone experiences
this, nausea can interfere with the enjoyment and study of the artwork for those
it affects.  Conservation is another concern.  Digital art poses particular
worry because hardware constantly changes; in some instances it is becoming
obsolete.  VR also questions traditional art roles.  If the VR platform takes
off&mdash;as is expected&mdash;a curator could organize more virtual than physical
exhibitions.  And fewer gallery assistants may be needed in exchange for those
with technical expertise in case of technological malfunctions.</p>

<p>Does VR mean the demise of physical art institutions?  Probably not.  People
will likely continue to flock to see the Mona Lisa at the Louvre.  At the same
time, VR does pose some interesting alternatives.  For this reason, DiMoDA
should be commended.  Although VR is still in its early stages, DiMoDA
demonstrates this medium’s possibilities and opportunities.</p>
