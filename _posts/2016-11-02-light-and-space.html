<p>I knew I was in for a treat when I entered the “Light and Space” exhibition
at the Seattle Art Museum. The show features sculptures, some with reflective
surfaces and translucent materials, which are complemented by subdued paintings.
Individual works by Donald Judd and Robert Irwin immediately caught my eye, but
the cohesiveness of this show kept me lingering. Together, this exhibition
creates an active and ever-changing viewer experience.</p>

<p>The show’s title is a nod to the west coast art movement, Light and Space,
that began in the 1960s and 1970s. Reflective materials, color gradations and
prism-like effects were among the ways artists explored light and space in
sculpture and painting. The exhibition also includes Minimalist artwork, which
originated on the east coast in New York around the same time. This art is
characterized by geometric shapes and the use of unconventional materials, such
as industrial and manufacturing supplies. Selections associated with each
movement are brought together in this one-room show.</p>

<p>I am accustomed to seeing Light and Space art or Minimalist art in isolation,
but not together. The combination is laudable. It conveys the similarities and
differences between these two art movements in an experiential way.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>First, the similarities. The geometric theme abounds in this show: squares,
circles and rectangles. The ten displayed artworks are large in size and rich in
experience. The size alone draws you near, but the nuances&mdash;reflections, shadows
and color gradations&mdash;keep you lingering. The clean aesthetic in each piece
questions whether the artwork was made by man or machine.</p>

<p>Yet, differences between the movements manifest here. You sense the mass in
works by Minimalist artist Donald Judd. Shadows cast on the floor and walls
emphasize the weight of his steel and aluminum pieces. In contrast, there’s a
delicate appeal in the cast acrylic column by Robert Irwin, a Light and Space
artist. It reflects rays of light onto a white plinth extending onto the wood
floor.</p>

<p>There’s also an experiential component to the show. Judd’s “Untitled,”
consisting of a large, square box with a hollowed interior, sits on the gallery
floor&mdash;occupying your space. Its weighty presence evokes a fear-like quality, and
causes you to cautiously move around it. John McCracken’s “Untitled” does
something different. A square column made of stainless steel invites
interaction. Its reflective surface is another way to see artwork around the
gallery. There’s also a narcissistic quality to his work: it’s hard to avoid
your own reflection.</p>

<p>A joy of the show is watching others engage with art. A person spends about
30 seconds looking at an artwork, according to The J. Paul Getty Museum. Not
here. People are enthralled the artwork displayed, noticing how it changes over
time and space. A woman noticed the changing reflections in Irwin’s column as
she walked around it, pointing out and photographing rays of light.</p>

<p>“Light and Space” offers an engaging conversation through experience, not
words. The artwork tacitly asks you to see and understand art on your own terms.
The gallery space helps: a large room with tall white walls prevents
overcrowding. Above all, “Light and Space” rejuvenates two familiar movements in
a show that is both playful and thought-provoking.</p>

<cite>“Light and Space” is on show at the Seattle Art Museum until November 6.</cite>
