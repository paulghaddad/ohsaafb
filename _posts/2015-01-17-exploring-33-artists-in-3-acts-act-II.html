<p><em>In November 2014 Sarah Thornton, a writer and sociologist of art, published a book in the United States titled, “33 Artists in 3 Acts.” It will be released in many translations in 2015. Since this book is relevant for discussion, I will publish a series of posts to examine its arguments and highlight its contributions.  You can read the first two entries here: the <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/33-artists-in-3-acts-introduction/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a> and <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/exploring-33-artists-in-3-acts-act-I/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Act I" target="_blank">Act I: Politics</a>.  We explore Act II: Kinship today.</em></p>

<p>In Act II, the “what is an artist?” question is shaped through kinship.  Artists that collaborate or compete with other artists, use assistants and value supporters are paired with those that loath the help of others and deny influences and inspiration in their work.  Readers learn that Belgian-born artist, Francis Alÿs, for instance, enjoys collaboration and the exchange of ideas; conversely, American photographer, Cindy Sherman, prefers to work in isolation.  By cleverly pairing artists that value relationships and collaboration with those less keen on them, readers come to understand how kinship influences the artwork produced and the brands artists create.</p>

<p>In addition to platonic relationships, Act II and parts of Act III reflect art world relationships from another angle: the extent artists are inspired and influenced from their peers.  This inevitably raises questions of originality.  Some artists overtly deny the influence of others in their work.  Marina Abromovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> in Act III: Craft claims that she has “never been influenced by another artist.”  Rather, she says that waterfalls, forests and volcanoes inspire her.  Whereas Maurizio Cattelan openly acknowledges such influences.  “Originality doesn’t exist by itself,” Mr. Cattelan explains.  “It is an evolution of what is produced . . . Originality is about your capacity to add.”</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>On a macro-level, the changed role of the artist appears to reflect today’s society.  Act II: Kinship helps readers recognize this.  The advent of smartphones and social media sites&mdash;Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, among many others&mdash;connect people and information now more than ever.  Act II demonstrates that artists are interconnected within their world, too.  In many ways they have to be, as do people in virtually every industry.  In addition to creating art, artists connect individually to their world by conducting interviews, attending biennials and participating in talks.</p>

<p>Act II also uncovers the ways artists connect with others.  This point is illustrated with Mr. Cattelan, a recurring character in this Act, who candidly acknowledges these relationships: from his friendship and collaboration with Lucio Zotti to his professional relationship with Massimiliano Gioni, a curator and critic who formerly gave Mr. Cattelan’s interviews and lectures.  Likewise Cindy Sherman, although she detests delegation and prefers to be alone, maintains good relationships with her dealers to preserve her reputation.</p>

<p>Why does kinship matter?  The range of art world personalities Ms. Thornton interviews in Act II underscores the importance of relationships and the many forms they take.  This investigation denotes that artists today are not lone achievers.  Readers unearth the network of people and venues artists rely on or derive inspiration from, albeit some are more reticent about this than others.</p>

<p>What about the production of art?  And what constitutes as art today?  We’ll examine the art making process next in Act III: Craft.</p>
