<p>Louise Lawler’s “tracings”&mdash;outline drawings of her photographs&mdash;have put a new twist on the way we see art.  Ms. Lawler is known for photographing objects and artworks in their everyday environment, focusing on the context of viewership in a home, gallery storage or museum.  But her 2013 exhibition at the Ludwig Museum, <em>Louise Lawler: Adjusted</em>, offered yet another way to explore the context of art.  The influence of context and originality explored in Ms. Lawler’s photography are also themes examined in her “tracings.”  In response to Ms. Lawler’s work, Ludwig Museum director, Philipp Kaiser, wrote in the exhibition catalogue: “[The tracings] demonstrate empirically the further steps that can still be taken to explore the extreme ends and corners of pictures and their contexts.”</p>

<p>For 30 years, Louise Lawler has demonstrated how art is shaped by context, arrangement and surroundings.  We may think of a gallery or museum as an artwork’s natural setting, but the works have a history, a past life.  Ms. Lawler’s iconic photographs, such as <em>Pollock and Tureen</em> (1984), make this known.  The title captures the subject of this photograph: a Jackson Pollock painting with a tureen inside the home of private collectors, Mr. and Mrs. Tremaine.  The juxtaposition of objects within the photograph emphasize the private life of an artwork, and in this case, a nod to its domestic environment.  Ms. Lawler’s photographs underscore how a setting tells the viewer about the collector or institution.</p>

<p>A selection of “tracings” developed last year for the Ludwig Museum have physically moved contexts, and are now on view at London’s Spr&#252;th Magers gallery in an exhibition titled, <em>No Drones</em>.  Ms. Lawler developed black and white drawings in conjunction with artist and children’s book illustrator, Jon Buller.  Tracing Ms. Lawler’s existing photographs seemingly creates a dual effect.  First, familiar photographs about contexts take on new meaning when only the outlines of these very images are seen on a different medium and in a new context; second, the mostly black and white “tracings” implicitly ask us&mdash;the viewer&mdash;to add the color, creating the significance.</p>

<p>Context has played an important role in Ms. Lawler’s photography since the early 1980s.  Her “tracings” carry a similar theme but in a new vein&mdash;offering another means of seeing art.  <em>Pollock and Tureen (traced)</em> (2013), for instance, is a tracing of the original photograph, <em>Pollock and Tureen</em>.  These tracings not only appropriate her own image, but they also recall the iconic appropriation artist himself, Andy Warhol, specifically his <em>Do it Yourself</em> image.  Louise Lawler’s “tracings” and Warhol’s <em>Do it Yourself</em> both refer to a participatory culture: engaging the viewer to mentally and intellectually participate in the completion of an image.  Ms. Lawler’s collaboration with a children's book illustrator and the resulting black-and-white images suggest this very notion: it is up to the viewer to complete the work of art.</p>

<p>Born in Bronxville, New York in 1947, Ms. Lawler graduated from Cornell University in 1969.  Although the early 1980s marked the beginning of her career, the Ludwig Museum argues it was largely shaped by the institutional critique of the 1970s.  Photographing the display of other artists’ artworks brought outside ideas inside the museum, and consequently, reflected economical, historical and political factors.</p>

<p>For the past 30 years, Ms. Lawler’s work has been shown around the United States and in Europe.  Her inclusion at a Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition in 2009, <em>The Pictures Generation: 1974-1984</em>, is one notable example.  This was the first major museum exhibition to focus on the Pictures Generation: a group that came of age during the 1970s when culture and mass media were shaping art.  What began as a group with five artists&mdash;Troy Brauntuch, Jack Goldstein, Sherrie Levine, Robert Longo, and Philip Smith&mdash;eventually expanded, comprised of others also working in this period, including Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman and Louise Lawler.  This close group of artists shared social and political experiences, given their immersion in media and consumer culture.</p>

<p>The Wexner Center for the Arts debuted a second important exhibition in 2006: Ms. Lawler’s first museum survey in 2006, <em>Twice Untitled and Other Pictures (looking back)</em>.  This exhibition captured the depth of Ms. Lawler’s career from the 1970s to the present, including her well-known photographs and objects, such as her postcards and etched glasses.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art suggests Louise Lawler came of age during a time of growth in the economy and in the arts.  This fusion is underscored by Ms. Lawler’s photographs: exploring and capturing the social and economic factors of artworks by peering into their private lives in a collector’s home or institution.  The black and white “tracings” of the same images, however, imply yet another interpretation: the remains from this once booming economic time.  Indeed, Louise Lawler’s “tracings” bring new meaning to the adage, “A picture is worth a thousand words.”  As her iconic photographs and, most recently, her “tracings” suggest, it may not be about the actual image at all.  Rather, it is the context that gives a photograph or “tracing” its meaning.</p>
