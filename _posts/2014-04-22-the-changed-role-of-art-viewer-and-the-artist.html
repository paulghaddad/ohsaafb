<p>Christie’s Auction House in Mayfair (London, England) recently presented a private selling exhibition of kinetic art from Europe and Latin America, <em>Turn Me On</em>.  With over 55 works on display, this exhibition spanned three floors and focused on motorized kinetic artworks created between the 1950s and 1970s.  These pieces reflect the new artistic tendencies explored during the post-war era: artists became fascinated with movement in art, resulting in new interactive and visual experiences for the viewer.  Placing the traditional static, handcrafted object aside, artists saw beauty in mechanical movement, optical illusion, technology and processes.  This exhibition opened a cross-cultural conversation that moved beyond visual aesthetics and into the realm of ideas.  This collaborative exhibition led to viewers making connections between kinetic art and other art movements that incorporated similar themes, while contemplating the reasons behind these new artistic interests during the postwar period.</p>

<p>G&uuml;nther Uecker’s, <em>New York Dancer</em> (1965), exemplifies some of the chief concerns for kinetic artists.  A beige linen cloth covered with nails that stick out like spikes covers this cylindrical-shaped piece sitting atop a metal platform.  The large red button, connected by a cord extending from the platform, entices apprehensive viewers, since it is an unspoken rule not to touch the art object.  <em>New York Dancer</em>, as many pieces in this exhibition, was an exception.  Kinetic artists were fascinated with interactive viewer relationships.  Involving the viewer included a simple, but necessary, action to start the motor&mdash;to propel this artwork into motion.  Imagine if <em>New York Dancer</em> was a static object.  How would it impact the message conveyed?</p>

<p>Physical and intellectual viewer engagement demonstrates the concepts explored by artists during the postwar era.  Pressing the button sends the anthropomorphic figure in <em>New York Dancer</em> swirling atop its metal platform. The motor becomes louder the longer the button is pressed, causing the <em>New York Dancer</em> to spiral out of control. While in motion, the linen cloth and nails extend, making a chime sound once the motor button is released, and the piece begins to slow.  Far from a smooth dance, as one may associate with the title, <em>New York Dancer</em>, Uecker’s piece is basic in every sense: aesthetically, the mundane materials suggest a handmade, organic quality evocative of Arte Povera; the rudimentary action is rough&mdash;a sensation that is seen and heard.  The aesthetic choices appear to be intentional: instead of focusing on the visceral qualities, viewers become acutely aware of the sounds, movements and technology.  Indeed, the themes explored in this piece and throughout the exhibition encouraged the viewer to contemplate the parallels between kinetic art and other other movements, such as conceptual art, which employed similar themes.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Viewer interaction and interests beyond visceral aesthetics are two key themes from the Christie’s exhibition that the New York-based German Conceptual artist, Hans Haacke, explored in his <em>MoMA-Poll</em> (1970).  Instead of presenting an object for contemplation, <em>MoMA-Poll</em> confronted visitors with a political question upon entrance to the Museum of Modern Art: “Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon’s Indochina policy be a reason for you not to vote for him in November?  Answer: If ‘yes’ please cast your ballot into the left box if ‘no’ into the right box.”  Museum visitors were given ballots to ‘cast their vote’ in one of the two transparent boxes. The votes were tallied each night, and results changed daily until the end of the exhibition when 68.7 percent of visitors voted ‘yes’ and 31.3 percent of the visitor’s voted ‘no’ to the posed question.  Indeed, Haacke involved the viewer physically, by casting a ballot, and intellectually, by thinking and responding to the posed political question.  Instead of visual aesthetics, <em>MoMA-Poll</em> evoked an exchange of information resulting in a political consciousness on the part of the viewer.  Thus, the inevitable question is raised: What caused artists to explore ideas, instead of visceral characteristics?  And why this interest in the viewer?</p>

<p>Societal changes in the postwar era is one way to explore the artistic changes taking place between the 1950s and 1970s.  Helen Molesworth’s article, <em>Work Ethic</em>, argues how the shifting post-war economy in America had a critical impact on the arts: the American economy shifted from an industrial to a postindustrial economy based on services and managerial labor.  As a result, Molesworth notes, the art object began to diminish, and the roles of the artist and viewer began to change.  “Artists no longer needed to content themselves with the production of visually aesthetic objects,” she explains, “Art became a realm of ideas.”  Although explored in different ways, both Uecker and Haacke reveal this very notion: the large red button next to <em>New York Dancer</em> is an overt reference for the viewer interaction Uecker desired in order  to explore technology, movement and sound; Haacke physically and intellectually engaged the viewer in an exchange of information, bringing political awareness from the outside world inside the museum.  Indeed, by following Marcel Duchamp’s notion that “the creative act is not performed by the artist alone,” the artist turned to the viewer to complete the creative act&mdash;a tactic employed by both Uecker and Haacke.  Thus, the changes in the art object also impact the viewer, and cannot go unstated.</p>

<p>“The spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications,” Marcel Duchamp argues, “and thus adds his contribution to the creative act.”  <em>New York Dancer</em> and <em>MoMA-Poll</em> feature the critical role of the viewer, to which these pieces could not function without.  Physically involving the viewer propelled the works, allowing the viewer to intellectually determine the meaning of the piece through the ideas explored, and consequently, adding to the creative act of the artwork.  Yet, this exhibition also demonstrates that the interaction with the artwork need not be physical: intellectual engagement also generates similar ideas.</p>

<p>Jean Tinguely, a Swiss sculptor who explored and experimented with mechanics, intellectually engages the viewer through consistent movement in his piece, <em>Cl&eacute; du Soleil</em> (1979), which also displayed at the Christie’s exhibition.  This rusted iron sculpture, resembling an abstract stick figure, with knees bent and leaning forward, is placed on a plinth with an electric motor that repeatedly propels a top portion of the sculpture in a circular motion&mdash;a movement that is seen and heard.  Although Tinguely keeps with the themes of movement and technology, <em>Cl&eacute; du Soleil</em> continuously runs without the aid of the viewer.  While this piece does not ask for the viewer’s physical involvement, it does ask for intellectual thought: What is the broader rationale for the construction of this piece?</p>

<p>The consistent sound of the motor and the perpetual circular motion in <em>Cl&eacute; du Soleil</em> brings to mind American artist, Robert Morris, and his <em>Box with the Sound of its Own Making</em> (1961).  It includes a wood box on a plinth with a recorder inside that plays the sounds of Morris constructing the box: sanding and nailing it together.  This piece is about the work that goes into it&mdash;a work that the viewer does not see, but hears from the tape recording from within.  Instead of an object of contemplation, this piece is about the work that went into its completion.  Morris’s piece underscores Helen Molesworth’s reference to Leo Steinberg’s essay, ‘Other Criteria’: “new art presents itself not as ‘art’ but as ‘work,’ and as such needs to be analyzed in sociocultural terms in addition to those taken from the discourse of art.”  Both <em>Cl&eacute; du Soleil</em> and <em>Box with the Sound of its Own Making</em> engage the viewer by alluding to this idea of work, and invite the viewer to think about art in a broader context.  Morris emphasizes the work involved to make a piece of art with his recorder, while Tinguely refers to principles of motion and movement, and the automatic nature of machines.  Once again, this refers to Helen Molesworth’s argument regarding the economic influence on art&mdash;from art to work.</p>

<p>The artists displayed at Christie’s exhibition experimented with new materials, processes and technology, thereby redefining traditional art parameters.  Helen Molesworth argues: “The liberation of art from traditional artistic skills, the production of the unique object, and the primacy of the visual necessitated new aesthetic criteria less focused on appearance and more concerned with ideas.”  Moving past visceral concerns, the viewer contemplates the influence and impact of social happenings between the 1950s and 1970s on art and the viewer.  Thus, <em>Turn Me On</em> exceeded its intended aim, “to assess this dialogue with a specific focus on the unique artistic collaborations and exchanges between Latin America and Europe.”  The collaborative approach of this exhibition opened itself up to a larger conversation that enabled the viewer to examine more broadly how and why artists were exploring such ideas not only in Latin America and Europe, but also in the United States.</p>
