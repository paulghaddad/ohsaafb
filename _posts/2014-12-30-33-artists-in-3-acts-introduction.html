<p>In November 2014 Sarah Thornton, a writer and sociologist of art, published a book in the United States titled, <em>33 Artists in 3 Acts</em>.  It will be released in many translations in 2015.  Since this book is relevant for discussion, I will publish a series of posts to examine its arguments and highlight its contributions. I begin today with the book's introduction and overall scope.</p>

<p><em>33 Artists in 3 Acts</em> is an ambitious and entertaining book.  In a world where anything can be art, Ms. Thornton aims to uncover being a professional artist today.  More explicitly, she interviewed 130 artists to investigate how artists “move through the world and explain themselves,” as she puts it, and in doing so she may upend readers’ perceptions of who artists are and what they do.  But ultimately she lets the reader decide.  Ms. Thornton’s strengths are her sociological approach towards art and an engaging writing style that enables readers to compare and contrast artists.</p>

<p>The book is organized into three “Acts,” exploring politics, kinship and craft, respectively.  Each Act is filled with “scenes” that examine the different characters (artists) from around the world.  The interviews that make up each scene take place in artists’ homes and studios, restaurants, gallery openings and biennials.  This methodology takes readers inside the mind and life of artists: captivating readers in the encounters as bystanders.  Ms. Thornton substantiates each interview with context&mdash;providing research, artwork analyses and pertinent biographical information&mdash;while intermittently interjecting bits of humor.  Future posts will tackle each Act.</p>

<p>Since the artist’s role has changed considerably during the past few decades, there is an opportunity for this book.  Take Abstract Expressionism, a movement that began in America during the 1940s.  It consisted of artists sharing similar beliefs: Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, among others.  Given the context of war and its aftermath, these artists were inspired and influenced by Existentialism, Surrealism and ancient mythology.  “Heroic individuality,” as art historian David Joselit describes it, united these artists.  Their artwork reflected the inner-self, using art to externalize emotion.  Abstract Expressionists were regarded as heroes, and their artwork as heroic labor, Mr. Joselit explains.</p>

<p>Following the war, some artists took on another role in post-industrial America, as Helen Molesworth uncovers in her essay, <em>Work Ethic</em>.  Goods began to be mass-produced, instead of being hand-made, and society shifted from a manufacturing economy towards a service-based one.  Many artists followed suit, taking a more “managerial” approach towards art.  Take John Baldessari's piece, <em>I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art</em> (1971), in which he instructed students to write this phrase of the same name on gallery walls.  Sol LeWitt’s <em>Wall Drawing #260</em> (1975) is another example.  LeWitt removed his hand as the artist, and relied on his instructions to mediate between himself and the draughtsman that physically executed the work.  These artists created directions for others to follow&mdash;a practice that paralleled the managerial role in the rising service sector in American society.</p>

<p>And we must not forget Marcel Duchamp.  Despite the changes in art and artists in recent decades, Duchamp’s influences are pervasive today.  More interested in the ideas generated by art, rather than its “retinal” or visual qualities, Duchamp shocked the art world with the debut of <em>Fountain</em> (1917), an upended urinal.  This piece along with his other “readymades,” mass-produced objects that were already made, underscored his desire “to put art back in the service of the mind.”  He indeed opened up the realm of art, and argued: “An ordinary object [could be] elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist.”</p>

<p>This is where Sarah Thornton enters.  She recognizes Duchamp’s important contribution: artists have enormous freedom deciding what art is.  She also acknowledges the expanding role of artists today; it is not only the artwork produced, but also the brands they create.  The way artists present themselves and the extracurricular activities they participate in shape their roles: from Maurizio Cattelan’s uniquely designed T-shirts to the talks and interviews artists participate in, or the gallery openings and biennials they attend.</p>

<p>In a world of infinite artistic possibilities, and in an artworld that is increasingly global, Ms. Thornton raises a pertinent question at an appropriate moment: What is an artist?  Her sociological approach helps derive the answer.</p>

<p>This book is an informative and entertaining read.  So I hope you will join me in reading and analyzing it.  We delve into the details next week . . .</p>
