  beautiful and thought-provoking.</em></p>

<p>On a frigid evening in early January I ventured out to Zg Gallery to see
their latest group exhibition, “Para Natural World.” I tend to avoid gallery
openings because they are usually bustling with people, which is great for the
gallery but not so great for viewing art. But I figured the Chicago exhibition would
be desolate, since it was nearly zero degrees outside. I was wrong: people were
out in droves.</p>

<p>The chance to see a new painting by Steve Hough, an English artist based in
Wisconsin, was my motive for attending the opening. I’d seen Hough’s work in the
past, and found myself mesmerized by his simple motifs that suggest qualities in
nature, such as dimples of sand on a beach. His latest work, “The “R” of Entropy,” mimics the ripple of a pebble piercing the surface of a blue body of water; gradations of circles emanate to the painting’s edge. When I got word that this new painting would be displayed, I knew I had to see it.</p>

<p>Upon entering Zg Gallery, I meandered through small groups of people sipping
glasses of wine as I looked for the painting. I found it hanging in a small side
gallery&mdash;distinct from the other artwork on show. In part this was because of its
physicality, about seven feet wide, but also its reflections of color and light
              stopped me in my tracks. Rather than a slab of blue paint on a
              canvas, the painting’s hypnotic circles had a three-dimensional
              quality that radiated light beautifully. In short, “The “R” of
              Entropy,” like his others, was aesthetically delightful. Yet
              something was different: seeing this painting in a gallery full of
              people allowed me to experience Hough’s work in an entirely new
              way.</p>

<p>For awhile I basked in its surface qualities. Facing “The “R” of Entropy,” I
noticed how the gallery’s bright lights accentuated the tactility of the circles
wound tightly in the center. At the same time, they highlighted the softness of
the circles that had flattened towards the painting’s edges. I wanted to see how
the lights affected the painting from other angles, and was surprised the shades
of blue changed as I moved side to side.</p>

<p>More wonderful still was the painting’s reflective quality. It wasn’t
mirror-like, yet I recognized the shapes and outlines of myself and others. I
also saw artwork by other artists hanging on neighboring walls; scenes from Amy
Casey’s city paintings blurred in the ripples of Hough’s painting. What caught
my eye, though, were the circles reflecting unobtrusively, but expansively, onto
the gallery floor. This dialogue between painted and reflected color proved to
              be an unexpected joy of the show.</p>

<p>That wasn't all.The best part of the painting was the contemplative
experience it generated. This is mostly because its color and subject echo a
moment in nature. For many people being in nature is a way to de-stress and get
lost in another world, whether you’re hiking in Yellowstone National Park, scuba
              diving in Belize, or sitting on Cathedrals Beach in Spain. “The
              “R” of Entropy” takes you to this other world. Seeing what looks
              like an ever-changing body of water was a mental retreat to
              peaceful moments I’ve spent in nature: thinking, looking, and
              reflecting.</p>

<p>I’d noticed this soothing, meditative quality in Hough’s past work, like
“Pass,” when I was one of two people in the gallery. It’s easy to get lost in
thought when nothing completes for your attention. However, seeing “The “R” of
Entropy” during a crowded opening emphasized its meditative effect. Despite the
stimulus going on around me&mdash;people chatting, laughing, and strolling
throughout the gallery&mdash;the painting commanded my attention and
interaction, resulting in a fascinating occurrence that I would’ve missed had I
opted to see it on any other day.</p>

<p>For some “The “R” of Entropy” is simply aesthetically pleasing; it would
certainly be a talking piece among friends in a Chicago high-rise. For others
the art historical references and theoretical underpinnings make this work
admirable. The changing and reflecting color in Hough’s painting recalled
artists like John McCracken, James Turrell, and Robert Irwin, among others
associated with the Light and Space art movement. (This movement began during
the 1960s and 1970s on America’s west coast as artists explored visual effects
of light using glass, fluorescent lights, and cast acrylic, among other
materials.)</p>

<p>Indeed, the aesthetics pulled me in and the art historical and theoretical
foundation gave the painting meaning and structure. But, for me, seeing Hough’s
work in a different context resulted in a captivating experience that
underscored the power of a painting.</p>
