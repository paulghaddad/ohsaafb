<p>Marina Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> calls herself “the grandmother of performance art,” and aptly so.  She has pushed herself physically, mentally and emotionally for decades.  Her early performances were frequently associated with inflicting pain on herself&mdash;often teetering on the edge of extremes.  Undoubtedly testing the physical limits in past performances, the audience is another major theme throughout Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s oeuvre.</p>

<p>Performances from Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s <em>Rhythm</em> series exemplify her reputation for pushing the boundaries.  She used a knife to quickly stab the spaces between the fingers of her left hand, which lay spread on a floor in <em>Rhythm 10</em> (1973), for instance.  Tape recording the performance functioned as a set of instructions.  After inevitably cutting herself, she changed the knives until all had been used.  Then, she would rewind the tape and start again.  Another example includes <em>Rhythm 5</em> (1974) when she lay inside a burning wooden star; a bystander saved Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> when she lost consciousness due to lack of oxygen.</p>

<p>Despite the elements Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> endures, her audience remains fundamental.  “The relation to the audience is the essence of performance . . . Every single person in the audience is important,” Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> once said.  This statement culminates in her current exhibition at London’s Serpentine Gallery, <em>512 Hours</em>, where visitors become the “performing body”, the Serpentine Gallery suggests.</p>

<p>In an exhibition without a visual stimulus, the audience makes <em>512 Hours</em> function.  The performance consists of Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> and a collection of props, which she may or may not use, six days a week, in a performance that lasts from 10am to 6pm, for a total of 512 hours.   Visitors receive a pair of soundproof headphones before entering the gallery in what is initially an eerily quiet space.  Not knowing exactly what to expect, audience members are vulnerable to the situation.  Looks of uncertainty fill the expressions on visitor’s faces, suggesting “we are all in this together.”  But this uncertainty is partially the point; visitor action, or inaction, determine the outcome of the performance.  Relying mostly on eye contact and behavioral forms of communication, Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> and her assistants guide visitors to stand in particular areas or walk very slowly together through the gallery.  Or visitors take their own initiative, staying in the gallery as long as it is open.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>The audience is a common theme throughout Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s work, albeit through different means.  In <em>Rhythm 0</em> (1974), for instance, Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> set up an experiential situation&mdash;leaving it up to the audience to determine the fate of the performance.  Over 70 objects, including grapes, a rose, a Polaroid camera and a gun with a bullet, were placed on a table; a set of instructions invited the audience to use the objects as they wished, treating Ms. Abramović’s body as an object.  Yet, this performance came to an abrupt end six hours later when an audience member held the gun to her head.  “That was the heaviest piece I ever did because I wasn’t in control,” Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> later commented, “The audience was in control.”</p>

<p>The Museum of Modern Art exhibition in 2010, <em>Marina Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>: The Artist is Present</em>, is a more recent example of Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>'s means of incorporating the audience.  This retrospective included 50 works over the course of her 40 year career.  <em>The Artist is Present</em>, is one piece that denotes Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s extreme performances focusing entirely on the audience.  In this live performance, Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> spent over 700 hours sitting silently in a wooden chair peering into the eyes of whoever sat across from her.</p>

<p>Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s early performances emphasize physical endurance.  Her more recent works, however, underscore the mental stamina needed to complete a work of art, while still highlighting the audience’s importance.  Although very little visual stimuli competes for the visitor’s attention at the Serpentine Gallery, the mental impetus is nearly inescapable.  The visitor contends with the 21st century racing mind that is forced to slow down through the lack of visual stimuli, imposed silence and removal of what we consider lifelines today: smartphones, iPads and any other electronics or belongings.  Indeed, visitors are asked to leave all personal items in the lockers provided before entering the exhibition&mdash;perhaps a symbolic request to remove the baggage before entering a seemingly transcendental space.</p>

<p>The meaning of the show, if any, is entirely subjective.  Experiencing silence is too much to bear for some, as is the uncertainty or the forced slowness of time.  Pacing around the gallery, some appear to find this performance an anxiety-driven show about nothing.  Perhaps that is the goal.  “The hardest thing to do is something that is close to nothing,” Marina Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> once said.  But some appear to enjoy a state of nothingness: becoming entranced in a state of meditation, basting in a few moments, or hours, of solitude.  The peaceful state of some visitors, relaxed posture and closed eyes suggest enjoyment in the experience.  Regardless of the interpretation, <em>512 Hours</em> tacitly asks viewers to look, feel and experience space and time, and thus calling attention to the subtleties of what constitutes as performance art.</p>

<p>What is next for Marina Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>?  It can only be assumed this groundbreaking performance artist will not only push physical or mental extremes, but will also critically involve the audience in some way.  Together, these elements appear to be the perfect recipe to reach her ultimate goal.  Since she herself has acknowledged that “a powerful performance will transform everyone in the room.”</p>

<cite><em>“512 Hours”</em> is on show at Serpentine Gallery, London, until 25 August 2014.</cite>
