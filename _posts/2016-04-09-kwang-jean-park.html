<p>“2013.15” is one of the first pieces of art you see upon entering Kwang Jean
Park’s solo show, “Dansaekhwa: Korean Contemporary" at Andrew Bae Gallery in
Chicago. This large, earth-toned oil painting has a gentle wave-like motif. Its
oscillating movements are soothing; your mind’s eye imagines the lines rolling
beyond the confines of the canvas. The show’s abstract works and
the gallery’s peaceful atmosphere encourage study and reflection.
It’s an apt environment to contemplate the artist’s work, which Andrew Bae, the
gallery’s director, describes as a fusion of “Asian ideas and philosophies about
nature.”</p>

<p>“2013.15” sets the tone for what follows. It’s part of an aesthetically
beautiful exhibition evoking careful consideration to human relations with
nature, but in a refreshing way. In part this is because harmony and balance
emanate throughout each artwork and the curation. The show also champions personal
interpretation, underscored by abstract representations of nature and numerical
titles. Bae says “your imagination is your limitation.”</p>

<p>Each artwork offers a similar aim, but the show is far from redundant; the
visual representations vary as does the experience. Whereas “2013.15” suggests
calmness, “2013.04” radiates with energy.  At first blush, the dance of
color and line making up this image recalls Jackson Pollock’s drip paintings.
But Kwang does something different here.  Dots of color come together to form a
dense circular shape.  You see and feel the central pull.  At the same time,
individual dots and lines of color extend to the confines of the canvas, like
confetti.</p>

<p>The works that pack the biggest punch are the four mixed media paintings set
on the floor, leaning against a wall. The technique and representation are
similar to 2013.04, but the impact is greater with four such images placed
side-by-side: vigor enemates, and the zeal is palpable. The repetition also
intensifies a central theme of the show: understanding our universe.  “[The
universe] looks chaotic at first sight, but there is a certain law and order,”
Andrew explains.  He’s right.  The multitude of dots and lines seem
disorganized, but there is “a certain harmony.”  That is, fragments come
together to form a whole&mdash;restoring peace and balance. </p>

<p>Contrast these paintings with four collaged images directly across on another
wall.  The organization is immediately apparent.  The mostly geometric shapes
imply order and stability.  The juxtaposition between these two series is most
thrilling: suggesting two ways to view the world and ourselves.</p>

<p>“Dansaekhwa: Korean Contemporary" seems to celebrate the world we have and
our relationship to it. The exhibition’s messages are not overt. You
must take time to think, sense and understand. Imagine the dynamics of the earth
working in unison; consider the meditative qualities nature offers; feel
yourself at peace.  The result is a thoughtful experience needed in today’s
chaotic world.</p>

<cite>“Dansaekhwa: Korean Contemporary” is on show at Andrew Bae Gallery until April 16, 2016.</cite>
