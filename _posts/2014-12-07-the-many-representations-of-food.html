<p class=no-indent><em>Jackson Junge Gallery in Chicago debuts a thought-provoking and enjoyable group exhibition examining food and drink.</em></p>

<p>“You are what you eat.”  This truism takes a physical form in Eric Cooney’s artwork (2014) of the same name in the group exhibition, <em>Eat, Drink &amp; Be Merry</em>, on show at Jackson Junge Gallery in Chicago.  “The popularity of food is extraordinary these days,” explains gallery director, Chris Jackson.  And rightly so.  Food is an intrinsic part of life and culture, perhaps more so today than ever before.  Cooking shows and competitions on television are ubiquitous, as are food documentaries telling the dangers of sugar, corn and meat.  With the holidays looming in Chicago&mdash;a city known for its food&mdash;an exhibition that reveals the many representations of food is a timely one.</p>

<p>Though the exhibition recognizes the darker side of food, including over-indulgence and the conceivably negative ingredients we fill our bodies with, there is also a lighter, fun side.  One of the images visitors to Jackson Junge Gallery cannot miss is Laura Lee Junge’s painting, <em>Vintage Vino</em> (2012). This opulent and festive scene is filled with animated figures and bottles of wine that seemingly underpin the exhibition title itself: eat, drink and be merry.  “[<em>Vintage Vino</em>] gives different reaction,” Mr. Jackson offers.  “People are relating to themselves in a way because of the personification of the bottles and the association with ‘I drank that wine’ or ‘that is a friend of mine.’ ”  Further along are perhaps the more nostalgic images of food associated with childhood: Pamela Johnson’s paintings of Hostess cupcakes and Gummi Bears.</p>

<p>These celebratory food scenes are paired with vexed ones.  The exhibition “comment[s] on our society and how gluttonous [it] has become,” Mr. Jackson adds.  Lina Dent’s <em>Glut</em> (2013) says it all.  A papier-m&#226;ch&#233; mask of a pained face protruding from a painting filled with cakes, cookies and candies not only points to over-indulgence.  It also implies the consequences of overeating: obesity, diabetes and many other health issues.  Or take Karen Hanrahan’s photograph, <em>Coned</em> (2013).  An image of an exploding chicken recalls the inhumane animal treatment and debates about the quality of meat in America today&mdash;topics made popular by contemporary food documentaries.</p>

<p>The subjective quality of food is inherent in this exhibition.  Alexandra Buxbaum’s <em>Ready for Market</em> (2009), a photograph of slaughtered pigs, could appear as fresh meat to some and grotesque to others, suggests Mr. Jackson.  “Different cultures have different relationships with food and how they perceive it.”  This is what makes this exhibition so great.  Food is multidimensional, which this exhibition reflects: food as fun, experimental, scientific, nostalgic or as a means of activism.</p>

<p>Food is often associated with enjoying a meal with family and friends, and the timing of this exhibition reminds us of that.  Although food still carries these connotations, it also bleeds into other aspects of life: from a scientific breakdown of the ingredients in a hamburger to the gluttonous consumption of sugary treats.  Despite the subject depicted, there is a pervasive attribute throughout: “[It] makes you think,” Mr. Jackson offers when asked about the response to the show.  “It creates and provokes conversation . . . if art can make you do that&mdash;stop and take notice and have a commentary&mdash;it usually leads to more conversation throughout the exhibit.”  And that it does.</p>
