<p>It’s become customary to be wowed by computers today.  IBM’s supercomputer,
Watson, beat former <em>Jeopardy!</em> champions Ken Jennings and Brad
Rutter in 2011.  More recently, Google’s AlphaGo eclipsed Lee Sedol in a
challenge of Go, an ancient board game.</p>

<p>These computer systems used artificial intelligence (AI) to outshine humans.
While board and game show victories are exciting, they overshadow the practical
benefits of AI. Consider three ways AI is productively used
by creative industries: music, writing and the visual arts. </p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>Music to my ears</strong></p>

<p>First, music.  David Cope, a composer and scientist, has long used algorithms
to compose music.  He was commissioned to write an opera several decades ago
when writer’s block hit. To overcome it, he began a program that became
Experiments in Musical Intelligence (EMI).  Cope entered music into EMI’s
database; the program analyzed the music; and new works were created in a
similar style&mdash;based on commonalities between different works from the same
composer, according to Cope in a <a
href="http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/algorithmic-music-david-cope-and-emi"
   title="Algorithmic Music" target="_blank">Computer History Museum article</a>.  Cope has created subsequent program variations since EMI’s debut.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>There are several benefits to this music-making process.  After writing the
opera, Cope used EMI to create new musical scores, inspired by celebrated
composers, Bach, Chopin and Mozart, among others; thereby giving credence to the
view that these legendary composers are “still writing.”  A second is practical.
Programs like EMI can generate ideas that a composer may not have considered.</p>

<p>A <a
href="http://www.gizmag.com/creative-artificial-intelligence-computer-algorithmic-music/35764"
   title="Creative artificial intelligence computer algorithmic music"
   target="_blank">Gizmag
   article</a> highlights another gain of AI composition: using algorithms to
experiment effectively.  Writing a composition can be time-consuming, but “with
algorithms we can experiment in those ways to produce that piece in 15 minutes
and we can know immediately whether it's going to work or not," Cope explains in
the same article.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>AI and the written word</strong></p>

<p>AI programs can also write.  Similar to music, there are AI programs creating
articles using algorithms based on data.  <a
   href="https://automatedinsights.com" title="Automated Insights"
   target="_blank">Automated
   Insights</a> is a company doing
just that.  Its platform, aptly titled Wordsmith, automates the writing process
for companies like Yahoo and Allstate.  Automated Insights explains the process
on their website: the user provides data to Wordsmith and picks an article
design; Wordsmith creates the story.  The benefits are practical.  The company
claims to save people time, enhance productivity and engage audiences. </p>

<p>Before journalists fret about future job losses, think about the niche for a
platform like Wordsmith.  The program devours and parses through a lot of data,
compiling it into legible prose; it thereby produces portfolio and account
summaries, sales force reports and airline delays, among other types of
articles.  Similar to musicians using AI, Wordsmith also hints at efficiency:
let AI crunch data and put human labor towards other business needs.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>A work of art</strong></p>

<p>Third, the visual arts is another creative field using AI.  Take the recent
“DeepDream” exhibition and auction at the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts in
San Francisco.  Nearly a dozen artists trained artificial neural networks (NN),
or algorithms functioning like a human brain, which created artwork for the
exhibition.  This is a point of distinction.  Whereas traditional computer
algorithms are programmed by humans, Gray Area’s website points out, the
artificial NNs in the Deep Dream exhibition learned from substantial amounts of
data.  Then, the NNs created new images based on “learned rules and
associations.”</p>

<p>The result?  Some refer to the “DeepDream” artworks as “trippy” or
“psychedelic”; others make comparisons to Vincent van Gogh’s works.  Regardless
of the description, the critical point is that AI produced colorful patterned
forms based on learned associations.</p>

<p>More broadly, AI is expanding traditional art boundaries as the fields of art
and technology merge closer together.  Artists have always used
technology&mdash;tubes of paint were a novelty at one time&mdash;but “DeepDream” offered something different. Instead of an artist using technology, like a camera, smartphone or virtual reality, to aid their own creation of art, the technology itself created the art in “DeepDream.”</p>

<p>Adding to this, many of the artists in DeepDream have technology
backgrounds&mdash;a coding artist, engineer, virtual reality filmmaker were among
them.  Outside of AI, some computer programmers are using lines of code as a
means of self-expression.  The definition of an artist is expanding, and so it
the technology used to create art.  As AI pushes us to think about the creation
and production of art on different terms, resistance is expected.  But Simon
Colton, an AI researcher, puts it best in a <a
href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-08/07/can-computers-be-creative"
   title="Can computers be creative" target="_blank">Wired article</a>: "We're not meant to
agree what Art is, that's what drives it forward.”</p>

<p>Skeptics of AI’s artistic potential should recall the backlash photography
once received.  “Artists once feared that photography would kill painting,”
Francis Haskell, an English art historian, once said.  Painting is still alive,
but photography did affect it; Edgar Degas and Gerhard Richter are two painters
influenced by photography.  AI could follow a similar path. It is unlikely art
will reach its demise with AI, but it will call for new ways to produce,
understand and relate to it&mdash;much like photography.</p>

<p>There are mixed feelings about the strides AI is making.  Many are amazed at
AI’s strides in recent years.  Others are more fearful.  Research from the <a
   href="https://www.weforum.org/press/2016/01/five-million-jobs-by-2020-the-real-challenge-of-the-fourth-industrial-revolution"
   title="The real challenge of the fourth industrial revolution"
   target="_blank">World
   Economic Forum</a> predicts five million jobs will be lost by 2020 due to AI,
robotics and machine learning, among other technologies.  Whether you see AI as
compelling or alarming, what can be agreed upon is this: it is happening.</p>

<p>We have already seen how AI can dominate in game competitions.  But these
events seem like a mere prelude of AI’s potential.  Instead of fretting about
its future impact, many in the creative fields are learning to adapt and work
with AI to better their practices.  That is to say, creatives are demonstrating
the benefits of a collaborative mindset as our physical and digital worlds
continue to collide.</p>
