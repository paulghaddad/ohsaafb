    <p>James Turrell&rsquo;s first solo exhibition at Pace Gallery in London, England, <em>James Turrell: Recent Works</em>, exemplifies the adage: &ldquo;The longer you look, the more you see.&rdquo;  Instead of objects, Mr. Turrell uses light and space to explore optics and perception.  This exhibition includes four installations that span two floors, featuring two works from his <em>Tall Glass</em> series and two unseen works from his <em>Wide Glass</em> series.  Mr. Turrell&rsquo;s use of technology, light and architecture offers a spellbinding phenomenological experience.</p>
    
    <p><em>James Turrell: Recent Works</em> is an escape from the fast-paced contemporary world.  Walking into the dimly lit gallery underscores entrance into a subliminal space.  The gallery lighting is critical: it creates a meditative atmosphere conducive for receiving the brilliant colors emanating from his work.  The juxtaposition of yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, among other colors may seem unusual in another context; the blending and metamorphosing of these shapes and colors is visually captivating, while also evoking notions of time and ephemerality.  His piece, <em>Pel&eacute;e</em> (2014), for example, changes from a motif of three floating white, pink and red shapes to a glow of solid white.  The perception of color is further enhanced by the viewer&rsquo;s spatial relation to the work: standing near, from afar or to the side.  Moving around the installation is inevitable; part of the excitement in a Turrell exhibition is uncovering how the pieces were made.  <em>Kermandec</em> (2014) and <em>Pel&eacute;e</em>, two pieces from the <em>Wide Glass</em> series, use LED lights and a curved aperture to create a mesmerizing optical experience.</p>

    <p>The two pieces from the <em>Wide Glass</em> series and <em>Sojourn</em> (2006), from the <em>Tall Glass</em> series, are presented linearly in the ground floor gallery.  Contained in individual spaces with three walls, each installation allows for a unique experience.  <em>Sensing Thought</em> (2005), from the <em>Tall Glass</em> series, has its own gallery on the first floor.  <em>Kermandec</em> and <em>Pel&eacute;e</em> resemble large, horizontal plasma screen televisions built into a curved wall, emitting a soft glow of colored light; the rounded corners of <em>Kermandec</em> and <em>Pel&eacute;e</em> also match the curved wall.  <em>Sojourn</em> and <em>Sensing Thought</em> offer a similar sensorial experience, but consist of vertical rectangles with angled corners, matching the walls of their contained spaces.  This detail alone&mdash;matching the corners of the artwork to the architectural setting&mdash;underscores Mr. Turrell&rsquo;s attention to visual and architectural aesthetics.  The motif of color and light continues between installations; the color emitted from each piece reverberates on the gallery&rsquo;s white walls&mdash;inviting viewers to enter, explore and to participate in this perceptual experience.</p>

    <p>The contemplative environment and the subdued floating shapes of color in Mr. Turrell&rsquo;s exhibition are reminiscent of the abstract expressionist, Mark Rothko.  Both artists use color and large dimensions to encompass the viewer, tacitly asking for viewer participation, viscerally and emotively.  This suggests the crux of Mr. Turrell&rsquo;s exhibition: the viewer&rsquo;s affective perception of color and light over time.  What appears so simple is in fact very powerful.  Color is personal and subjective: everyone perceives color differently.  James Turrell implicitly asks for the viewer to look, explore and question; therefore, the more time spent with the artwork, the greater the opportunity to experience the unfolding nature of color and light.</p>
