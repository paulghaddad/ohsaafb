<p>Baron Georges-Eug&#233;ne Haussmann’s urban construction in 19th century France transformed crowded and unhealthy neighborhoods with its wide boulevards.  Serving social, economic and military functions, the well-lit boulevards exposed daily activities and brought large numbers of people together.  And the fl&#226;neur, one who is always watching or being watched, leisurely perused these Parisian streets.</p>

<p>The 19th century fl&#226;neur is relevant in the twenty-first century.  Photographer Stephen Wilkes captures the fl&#226;neur in contemporary terms at his solo exhibition at Rook &amp; Raven (London, UK), <em>Day to Night</em>.  The nine photographs on display depict fleeting moments of cityscapes from around the world.  Instead of walking the streets of New York City, San Fransisco, London or Paris, Mr. Wilkes uses technology&mdash;his camera&mdash;to capture contemporary life.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkes has been recognized for his commercial and fine art photography for over two decades.  For his recent <em>Day to Night</em> series, Mr. Wilkes spends 12 to 15 hours perched at least 50 feet above his subject in a single location taking 1,200 to 1,500 photographs.  After months of editing, this process culminates into one digitally blended photograph: depicting day to night. Mr. Wilkes explains: </p>

<blockquote><em>Day to Night</em> embodies a combination of my favourite things to photograph; people on the street melded with epic cityscapes, and the fleeting moments throughout the day and night . . . Seeing the subtle communication between pedestrians on sidewalks, cars and cabs on the street, these individual elements become a complex life form as they flow together to create a chaotic harmony.</blockquote>

<p>The 19th century fl&#226;neur walked the streets, taking in the sights of modern life.  And painters of modern life capture these fleeting moments, fashions, emotions and daily encounters.  Constantin Guys, for example, spent days seeing and observing, seeking the transitory and the fugitive.  His <em>Promenade aux Champs-Élyées</em> depicts people at leisure: men escorting women, ostensibly on a walk.  Guys forges a relationship between strangers occupying the city: two seated men taking note of the passing group before them, oblivious to their onlookers, with particular attention on the women in their large flowing gowns.  Indeed, the fleeting moments captured by 19th century artists return in Mr. Wilkes’s current exhibition.</p>

<p><em>Santa Monica Pier</em> underscores the major themes in this series.  First, with many small narratives within a larger narrative, Mr. Wilkes’s photographs encourage an active eye.  The photograph is filled with signifiers&mdash;cues such as the American flag, ‘Bubba Gump’ restaurant, and boardwalk&mdash;that help situate the scene.  The transitory moments in this image include people buying souvenirs, encountering others on the boardwalk and strolling along the beach.  And the many tourist attractions, such as the restaurants, vendors, beach and amusement park, encompass the Santa Monica Pier specifically, and American life generally.</p>

<p>Second, the many human interactions captured in the blended day and night image make a seemingly simple, aerial photograph complex.  Human behavior is multifaceted.  The clothing, body language and interaction between couples, individuals and families reveal a wealth of information about the captured scene.  Couples hold hands and individuals walk alone.  Depicting day to night adds to this human complexity, suggesting how human behavior changes depending on the time of day.  The two police cars, and a small gathering around one, reference an apparent arrest taking place, and consequently, the eeriness nighttime brings.  In contrast, carefree beach goers enjoy the daytime sunshine.</p>

<p>The idea of overlapping images from one location over time came from Mr. Wilkes’s earlier projects.  He also studied artist, David Hockney who worked in a similar way: pasting together over 200 images of a single scene.  Far from arbitrarily blending images together, the extensive editing process can take months.  The final product&mdash;a carefully matriculated image&mdash;consists of everyday routines and complex human interactions in recognizable settings.</p>

<p>“I'm drawn to cities that have not only fantastic architecture, but also fascinating street life,” Mr. Wilkes has said.  The interest in street life today parallels that of 19th century Paris.  Baron Georges-Eug&#233;ne Haussmann’s urban construction brought social interactions to the streets of Paris: fl&#226;neurs walked the boulevards and painters captured the passing moments.  Despite the vast number of societal changes since the 19th century fl&#226;neur roamed the Parisian boulevards, Mr. Wilkes’s <em>Day to Night</em> series underscores the innate fascination with human life and interaction.  And thus, over a century later, Mr. Wilkes’s interest with street life and human narrative makes him the quintessential contemporary fl&#226;neur.</p>
