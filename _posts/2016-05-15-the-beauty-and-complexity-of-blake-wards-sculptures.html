<p>Blake Ward's newest sculptural series, Spiritual Collection, is typified by
“Ushabti Renenet.” This bronze statue of a woman’s body stands less than three
feet tall, and is missing several body parts: a head, both arms and a leg.
Shoulders are square and back is arched; the body weight is supported by one
strong leg, perched high on the left toes.  The intact limbs are fragmented, but
“Ushabti Renenet” exudes confidence: she is bound for another place, and not
committed to the small pedestal on which she stands. </p>

<p>This piece is at the essence of “Inner Perceptions, Outer Reflections” at
Hilton-Asmus Contemporary in Chicago, and demonstrates Ward’s interest in the
human spirit.  The figure evokes traditional associations of the female nude:
ideal body proportions and graceful forms.  But sensuality is quickly usurped.
Move around the sculpture and the figure’s inside layers are revealed&mdash;analogous
to the inner qualities of our human existence.  The visitor is presented with a
decision: see the sculpture for its exposed physical beauty; its metaphysical
qualities; or both.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>“Inner Perceptions, Outer Reflections” addresses this dichotomy.  Ward, a
Canadian-born artist, has long created figurative works.  His Spirit Collection
comprising this show deviates from his past work of solid three-dimensional
sculptures.  The exposed bodily interiors are a point of distinction: enabling
the visitor to see in and through the figures. The representation underscores
Ward’s appeal in the inner quality of his work and our human existence&mdash;including
determination, integrity and spirit&mdash;as the artist explains on his website. This series
suggests there is more to a person than what is perceived from the outside, and
poses the visitor with a challenge: to focus on the person within, not just
outside the body.</p>

<p>The tacit call to action parallels what has become our world today: one of
surfaces.  Posting pictures and status updates on Twitter and Facebook are
commonplace; we repeatedly allow the world to see our exterior selves.  Social
media sites connect society more than ever, but these are often impersonal
associations at a surface level.  Indeed, the relevance of
Ward’s sculptures resonates loudly. </p>

<p>The message, then, is about the human condition.  It is a point made clear in
the dialogue between the exposed interior and textured exterior of each piece:
despite the imperfect physical rendering, there is still promise for humanity.
The sweeping curve of “Ushabti Hetheru’s” body hints at growth and development;
the erect stoicism in “Ushabti Tefnet” indicates an inner strength made visible.
“Angel Urim” faces the visitor squarely: balancing on the stub of a leg and
lifting the opposite shoulder, self-assuredly. Then, there is “Angel Valoel.”
The arched torso with neither legs nor arms leaned forward, implying a glimmer
of hope, or perhaps rebirth.  Taken by the intensity of these movements, the
visitor considers the figures’ motivation.  And this gets to the heart of the
show: looking beyond the exteriors to think deeply about the internal questions
overlooked today: what are we striving for?; who are we developing into?; what
is our purpose?</p>

<p>“Inner Perceptions, Outer Reflections” is compelling and timely.  Ward’s nod
to Classicism&mdash;both in the physical elegance of the sculpture and their titles,
many of which recall goddesses&mdash;is a reminder that humanity has always struggled
with its complexity.  Returning to this concept today is poignant in a world not
only operating at surface level, but also overcome by unfathomable human
destruction. </p>

<cite>“Inner Perceptions, Outer Reflections” is on show at Hilton-Asmus
  Contemporary in Chicago until June 24, 2016.</cite>
