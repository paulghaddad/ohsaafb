<p>“Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art,” Andy Warhol once famously said.
“Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.”  Warhol is remembered for his contributions as a business artist, and his influence on future artists is incontrovertible.  “Without [Henri de Toulouse-] Lautrec, there would be no Andy Warhol,” explains Cora Michael in a Metropolitan Museum of Art online article about the 19th century artist.  Lautrec, a French painter, illustrator and printmaker, is often remembered for his posters of Parisian entertainment, which coincided with the Industrial Revolution.  But his contributions to the commercialization of art are still relevant today amidst another revolution: a digital one.</p>

<p>This winter, visitors will appreciate Lautrec’s genius at a small but comprehensive exhibition at Northwestern University's Mary &amp; Leigh Block Museum of Art: <em>Toulouse-Lautrec Prints: Art at the Edges of Modernity</em>.  His career, cut short by an untimely death at age 36, is still influential: his means of production and subject matter enabled the masses to see and understand his lithographic posters.</p>

<p>This single gallery show engulfs visitors in a sea of spectacle.  Orange, violet and magenta walls showcase the nearly twenty pieces on display.  But it is not overdone.  In fact, this curatorial decision is quite effective and adds to the show’s commercial focus.  The color creates a welcoming environment that lures visitors in.  And the stimuli of lowbrow scenes within a confined space compete for a visitor’s attention&mdash;mimicking the pervasiveness of advertising today.</p>

<p>Some of Lautrec’s iconic posters are included in this exhibition, one of two highlights of the show.  <em>Divan Japonais</em> (1892) is one example: a poster of a caf&#233;-concert, which Lautrec frequented, portrays dancer Jane Avril and critic &#201;douard Dujardin in the foreground observing the performance of another star, Yvette Guilbert.  This poster typifies Lautrec’s use of striking colors, bold outlines and his Japanese influence.  <em>Aristide Bruant in his Cabaret</em> (1893) is another epochal piece.  Aristide Bruant commissioned Lautrec to create an advertisement to promote his cabaret.  The red scarf, wide-brimmed hat and cape fill this poster from afar.  Close examination reveals details of the businessman’s furrowed brow and pursed lips.</p>

<p>Reflecting on Lautrec’s influence on the commercialization of art today, both in terms of subject and means of reproduction, is the second highlight of the exhibition.  Lautrec reproduced images of everyday subjects, and others artists have since followed.  Andy Warhol made a career depicting mass culture, from Coca-Cola bottles to images of Marilyn Monroe; Keith Haring’s Pop-Shop sold items such as T-shirts and posters that incorporated his designs; Jeff Koons is famous for his balloon dog, rabbit sculpture and encased vacuum cleaners.  The elevation of low culture to high art threads these artists together.</p>

<p>The show’s reference to the mass-production of art also points to the commercialization theme.  “The technological reproducibility of the artwork changes the relation of the masses to art.”  This apt Walter Benjamin quote writ large on the violet wall across from the sole gallery entrance tacitly encourages visitors to think about the production of art.  Lautrec’s lithographic poster advertisements could be reproduced and placed around Paris.  Nearly 50 years later, Warhol used silkscreens to quickly create his images of Marilyn Monroe and Campbell Soup cans.  And today, Jeff Koons has used machines to produce his sculptures.</p>

<p>The Lautrec exhibition debuts during today’s digital revolution, underscoring the show’s relevance.  Immersed in a room of 19th century advertisements, visitors inevitably make connections, past and present.  Lautrec turned to lithographic posters as a means of reproduction.  Thanks to technology, reproduction is even quicker, easier and can reach a larger audience in the 21st century.  Many artists, as well as galleries and museums, turn towards social media, for instance, to instantaneously promote themselves, their artwork and their brands to the masses.</p>

<p>All too often Toulouse-Lautrec is synonymous with posters of Montmartre’s debased subjects.  Yet this exhibition is a reminder of Lautrec’s contributions and impact on the realm of art over a century after his death.  Visitors to the Mary &amp; Leigh Block Museum of Art will undoubtedly delight in some of Lautrec’s noteworthy pieces.  They will also see Lautrec anew&mdash;realizing his contributions as a commercial artist and his lasting impact on the commercialization of art today.</p>
