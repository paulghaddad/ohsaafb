<p>When we think of space, we usually think of its physical quality: to live, work and interact. We identify ourselves by spaces.  Some people name drop their particular neighborhood, city or country, which are inevitably associated with stereotypes: rich or poor; young or old; cultural or not.  Employees often have their own cubicles at work&mdash;a defined area often filled with personal belongings and work-related items that are also telling of an individual.  Or colleagues meet at the local Starbucks to discuss business.</p>

<p>Blain Southern’s current exhibition, <em>The Space Where I Am</em>, reveals that physical space is just one aspect to consider; it can also be illusionistic, verbal, figural and hierarchical.  This group exhibition includes artists from around the world&mdash;the United States, Ireland, Britain and Italy&mdash;whose work spans from the 1960s through the present day.  These artists not only convey the conventional and conceptual means of space through different media.  They also elucidate its multi-sensorial qualities: to walk over, see, hear and thus, experience space and art, anew.  It is the experience of space that unites seemingly disparate artworks.</p>  

<p>“Rather than cutting into the material,” the Minimalist artist, Carl Andre, once explained, “I now use the material as the cut in space.”  And his <em>36 Aluminium Lock Square</em> (1968), on display at Blain Southern, is a quintessential example.  Instead of hanging on the wall, this piece resides on the floor&mdash;intentionally “cutting” into the viewers space.  While most visitors may not give much thought to their walking paths in a gallery, Mr. Andre’s floor pieces call attention to this space, and the art itself.  Those unfamiliar with his work walk around the aluminum squares; whereas others walk on and over them, which is Mr. Andre’s intent.</p>

<p>Imagine consciously walking across this artwork, subtly feeling the aluminum beneath.  The experience is surreal: not many artists invite viewer to walk on their art.  <em>36 Aluminium Lock Square</em>, however, is much more than a rebellious act; it creates a hypersensitivity of space and action.  Rather than focusing on visceral qualities, Mr. Andre creates a situation for viewers where space and context matter.  As a result, space, materials and time are experienced in new ways.</p>

<p>Other works in this exhibition address space less overtly.  Lawrence Weiner’s <em>ROLLED INTO &amp; ONTO THE SEA</em> is one example.  Capitalized letters outlined in black are painted flat on a wall towards the ceiling.  Language is Mr. Weiner’s medium; the title alone is the work of art.  Instead of occupying physical space, this work addresses mental space: the mind inevitably applies images to these words.</p>

<p>While decoding meanings, images or messages in Mr. Weiner’s piece, a steady hum of voices from an adjacent gallery looms in the air.  Although given his own physical space, Bill Viola’s Presence is another work that does not exist concretely.  Yet, it can be heard and felt through the vibrations, unequivocally demonstrating the sensorial aspects experienced in space.  This sound installation consists of whispers of personal stories that are difficult to decipher, as the press release suggests.</p>

<p>James Turrell’s <em>Pullen (Red)</em> (1968) is another piece that denotes the many uses of space: a beam of light in a darkened room creates the illusion of a floating red triangle.  Perception is at the heart of his work.  “I want to create an atmosphere that can be consciously plumbed with seeing,” he explains, “like the wordless thought that comes from looking in a fire.”  Spending time with this piece unveils what Mr. Turrell is so famous for doing: setting up enormous fields of colored light, and creating an optical, phenomenological experience.</p>

<p>Space is all encompassing, and takes many forms in life and art.  Technology improvements in recent years have altered society’s conception of it.  Email, for example, instantaneously delivers messages around the world, reducing the need for the tangible “snail mail.”  And now, documents of all kinds can be saved “in the cloud,” instead of taking up physical space.  The artists in this exhibition explore similar ideas.  Artworks can take multiple forms, literally or figuratively, and impact the way space is experienced or perceived.  Rachel Whiteread, Tom Friedman, Lucio Fontana and Gordon Matta-Clark, among others included in Blain Southern’s exhibition convey, and sometimes question, this very fact.  Despite the different means, <em>The Space Where I Am</em> asks viewers to move beyond the literal aspect of space, and to experience its multiple dimensions.</p>
