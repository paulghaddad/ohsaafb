<p class="no-indent"><em>Two powerful exhibitions currently on display at the DePaul Art Museum reflect on America, both past and present.</em></p>

<p>The Roaring Twenties in America, a time of economic prosperity, came to a rapid halt when the stock market crashed on Tuesday, October 29, 1929, sparking the Great Depression.  In an NPR article, Wanda Bridgeforth, a survivor, vividly recalls the struggles brought on by the Great Depression: unemployment and poverty.  Her father went jobless, despite his chemistry degree, so her mother worked as a live-in domestic worker; Ms. Bridgeforth was sent to live with relatives and strangers, having to share a six-room house with nineteen people at one point.  But Ms. Bridgeforth was not alone.  Millions were left looking for employment and food.  And as banks failed, people’s savings were lost, leaving many with nothing.</p>

<p>Trying to unite a nation after the economic catastrophe of the late 1920s parallels the Great Recession of 2008, which many deem as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and its aftermath.  The art produced during these two poignant events in history&mdash;the Great Depression and the Great Recession&mdash;and the years that followed are telling of the American attitude, then and now.  These stories come alive in two exhibitions concurrently on display at the DePaul Art Museum in Chicago, <em>Ink, Paper, Politics: WPA-Era Printmaking from the Needles Collection</em> and <em>Fires Will Burn: Politically Engaged Art from the Permanent Collection</em>.</p>

<p><em>Fires Will Burn: Politically Engaged Art from the Permanent Collection</em> occupies the first floor of the Museum.  The artists included are as diverse as the subjects represented: slavery, Guantanamo Bay, immigration, race and the Vietnam War.  Together, the images representing controversial ideas suggest a divided America full of individual voices&mdash;one that is breaking apart instead of coming together.  Gerda Meyer Bernstein’s <em>The Justice Chair</em> (2012) is perhaps the most startling piece of all: a chair, draped in black on top of a round table, occupies its own room.  The imagery is chilling, and the content is heavy: individual pieces of x-ray film include the names and countries of origin of incarcerated prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<p>The economic repercussions of the 2008 Great Recession, such as the unemployment rate, are just one of the many issues facing America in the 21st century.  There are a host of others: terrorist attacks; controversial declarations of war in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Islamic State; and conflicting views on immigration.  These events, and the divisive views towards them, culminate in today’s attitude of America.</p>

<p>The upstairs exhibition, however, offers a different tone.  Despite the incredible challenges brought on by the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt wanted to unite the American people.  Part of the New Deal, a series of government programs issued with the intent to reinstate American prosperity, included the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which provided government financial support to artists.  Louise Lincoln, the director of DePaul University’s Art Museum, explains that these artists turned to the worker, showing people as strong and self-assured.  Indeed, the WPA promoted art that celebrated workers and the nation in order to restore confidence in the American people.</p>

<p><em>Ink, Paper, Politics: WPA-Era Printmaking from the Needles Collection</em> reveals artists of different races and genders coming together, giving a sense of purpose and identity during a tumultuous time in American history.  Rather than representing America’s problems, these images suggest better times ahead.  Harry Sternberg’s <em>Steel Mills</em> (1937) is an active industrial scene, indicates employment; Charles Wheeler Lock’s <em>The Box</em> (1943) points to a time when people can afford to dress-up and indulge in an evening out to the theater; Abe Blashko’s <em>The Pillars</em> (1939) depicts a large, stoic man in a tuxedo, exuding confidence.  Although these images differ in the subject portrayed, the overarching theme is ubiquitous: restoring trust in America and its people.</p>

<p>The two exhibitions tell a powerful history of America and the morale of its people following hard times.  Implicitly drawing parallels between these two exhibitions elucidates how problems of the day, past and present, are visually perceived.  Consequently, questions are raised: What is the government doing in the 21st century to address the issues at hand?  And what does it mean to be American today?  The answers to these questions&mdash;or more aptly, the hope for a solution&mdash;are seemingly found in the curation.  <em>Fires Will Burn: Politically Engaged Art from the Permanent Collection</em> denotes the issues that create a stark divide in America, whereas <em>Ink, Paper, Politics: WPA-Era Printmaking from the Needles Collection</em> suggests the need to come together when hard times hit, instead of breaking apart.</p>
