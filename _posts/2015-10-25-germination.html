<p class=no-indent><em>A group show at LVL3 in Chicago brings together three artists that explore germination in multiple ways.</em></p>

<p>Visitors attending the “Germination” exhibition at LVL3, a gallery in Chicago, should expect to be surprised by the connections the show offers. The title brings to mind seeds growing into plants. But the visitor cannot help thinking how the term germination has expanded after seeing an amalgamation of works created by Heidi Norton, Derrick Piens and Timothy Bergstrom. Although most of the fourteen pieces displayed elicit a reference to nature, the multiple perspectives and different media each artist use demonstrates a broader application of germination.</p>

<p>The diversity of the art contained under the germination theme reflects Chicago's current art and cultural endeavors, making “Germination” timely. The exhibition opened on the heels of EXPO Chicago, an international modern and contemporary art fair, and before the inaugural Chicago Architecture Biennial (CAB), which began October 3. More broadly, the 2012 Chicago Cultural Plan, an initiative of Chicago’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, is central to Chicago’s advancement “as a global destination for creativity, innovation and excellence in the arts,” the organization claims. CAB, for instance, is a result of this plan. In this context, germination is a relevant exhibition theme for a city implementing initiatives dedicated to Chicago’s culture and economic development. Fittingly, Norton, Piens and Bergstrom each offer a distinct lens to consider the topic of growth and transformation. Here is art that brings meaning and relevance to the outside world.</p>

<p>Upon entering this one-gallery show, visitors cannot miss Norton’s sculptures. Each of her four pieces evokes an experimental quality drawing viewers in. Take “The Plight (feeding Systems).” To the visitor, the sculpture looks like a lab experiment, complete with tubes, bamboo pieces and electrodes with a thermal switch, among other items. The bamboo suggests an ecological undertone&mdash;a nod to the natural systems governing our bodies and environs. And the system referenced in the title and simulated in the artwork could point to the circulatory systems in plants. The presentation is also important; it conveys a tension between the progressive attributes science can bring and the slowly evolving forces of nature. Juxtaposing Norton’s work alongside more traditional sculptures and paintings by Piens and Bergstrom differentiates her exploratory approach.</p>

<p>Other pieces worth noting are Piens’s sculptures. Instead of idealistic representations of nature, the artist’s choice of shapes and colors reflects its influence. “Quarter Cut” recalls a large, geomorphic-shaped rock covered in a shades of green and grey; “The Yield” suggests branches from a tree. Tellingly, his art process parallels that of nature. “Pieces develop over time,” he says. So does nature. For example, longleaf pines are “slow-growing” trees that can take 150 years to arrive at full size, and have a lifespan of more three centuries, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Adding to this, Piens goes on to explain the layers of color in his work: “Oftentimes I feel like I am wasting a lot of time and paint, but over time the layers of the different colors add a richness to the piece as well and plays off the surface.” In this instance, art, like nature, comes to fruition over long periods.</p>

<p>The incorporation of or reference to nature is a thread bringing these artists together. Whereas Norton directly incorporates nature into her work with bamboo and Piens draws inspiration from nature in his sculptures, Bergstrom alludes to it abstractly in several paintings. “Untitled” consists of vibrantly colored blob-like forms. And the shapes found in “For Nico” resemble flowers in a decaying state; the thick, tactility of paint adds a visual weight to this message. Both representations hint at a debased side of nature. It is a reasonable observation since Bergstrom explains his “favorite things harmonize the grotesque.”</p>

<p>A revelation of the show is how it broadens the traditional definition of germination: growing and adapting to a situation. It is a point made clear in Bergstrom’s painting “Matisse shapes,” which is filled with shapes evocative of Matisse’s cutouts&mdash;a technique Matisse turned to when poor health precluded him from painting. The reference suggests how the artist worked around his health constraints, learning to “paint with scissors.”</p>

<p>“Germination” implies how growth and adaptation are attributes in today’s progressive and ever changing society. It’s an important concept Chicagoans have been employing for several years in the realm of art and culture. But it is also applicable to the world at large in today’s fast-paced, technology-filled society. The internet and social media have already had a revolutionary impact, but advances in virtual reality and the debut of self-driving cars are among the many technological changes that will transform life once again, forcing society and the arts to adjust right along with them.</p>
