<p>Experimentation, innovation and curiosity are revealed in David Hockney’s iPad drawings.  The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco demonstrated Mr. Hockney’s reputation for engaging in new media and technology in its exhibition last fall: <em>David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition</em>.  This comprehensive survey, the first since 2002, included 300 images of diverse media: charcoal, watercolors and Mr. Hockney’s digital work on iPads.</p>

<p>David Hockney’s iPad prints and charcoal drawings are now on show at Annely Juda Fine Art in London.  <em>David Hockney: the Arrival of Spring</em> incorporates 20 color prints drawn on Hockney’s iPad that depict the arrival of spring in Yorkshire and 25 charcoal drawings of the same subject, including five drawings of Hockney’s favorite “totem” tree trunk and a video work.  This exhibition denotes diversity on a smaller scale, and tacitly asks for a critical eye to recognize the differences of the same subject in different media.</p>

<p>Mr. Hockney’s turn towards technology is not unusual.  He has used it throughout his career, and sees technology as an opportunity to experiment with new perspectives and create new ways to see and understand the surrounding world.  His iPad drawings are a quintessential example.  Preferring his fingers to a stylus, the iPad medium offers a quick form of experimentation and expression.  This medium, however, is a new technology that embraces an old technique.  Art historian Maureen Nappi links this drawing style with the beginning of art.  “These gestures are as old as humans are,” she argues.  “Go back to cave paintings, they’re using finger movements to articulate creative expressions.”</p>

<p>David Hockney was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, England in 1937 to parents who allowed their son to explore the world around him.  This mode of experimentation instilled in childhood is a common theme throughout Mr. Hockney’s prolific career; it is also indicative of his technological embrace.  Although formally educated at Bradford College of Art, and later the Royal College of Art in London, Mr. Hockney was largely self-taught.  Seeking to reproduce the simple and serene world, he provides pleasures that are often overlooked.  Indeed, a style that is enjoyable to look at is the essence of his work.  And this is a motif found in his subject matter during the mid-1960s.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Mr. Hockney was first associated with Pop Art.  Looking towards America, he made a trip to Los Angeles, California, in 1963.  Drawn to California’s way of life, relaxed and sensual, he began painting subjects that he will be always linked with: blue skies, beautiful people and swimming pools.  The latter became a frequent subject between 1964 and 1971.</p>

<p>Far from being defined by one style, however, Mr. Hockney has embraced technology in a career spanning over 60 years.  After the release of photocopiers, for instance, he experimented with ink cartridges.  As a painter, draftsman, photographer, stage designer and printmaker, his adoption of the iPad medium comes as no surprise.  The iPhone marked the beginning of Mr. Hockney’s experimentation with smart technology; but the iPad expanded the possibilities.</p>

<p>The exhibition at Annely Juda Fine Art demonstrates Mr. Hockney’s ability to work with different media.  His iPad drawings emit energy and experimentation through gestural lines and bright colors&mdash;a stark contrast from the controlled and contained charcoal drawings shown on the floor below.  The different genres call attention to visceral differences, and also emotive qualities.  Mr. Hockney’s landscape subject choice, along with the bold colors and expressionistic lines, recall Romantic painters between 1700 and 1900, for example, who used landscapes to convey emotion, such as vivid sunrises or turbulent storms.</p>

<p>Embracing technology is not a new phenomenon in art.  Mr. Hockney even wrote a book suggesting old masters did the same, by employing devices such as the camera lucida.  Yet using technology over time has seemingly propelled his career&mdash;eclipsing his Pop Art label, and expanding and developing as an artist practicing in many genres.  This fluidity with media and technology is underscored in the following statement from Richard Benefield from the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco: “Like an artist alchemist, in one minute Hockney uses a fancy digital device to make a colorful iPad drawing; in the next he shows us that he is one of our greatest draftsmen by rendering an exactingly detailed charcoal drawing of a forest scene in East Yorkshire.”  Given Mr. Hockney’s experimentation and adaptability throughout his career, perhaps equating him to an artist alchemist is most apropos for one of Britain's best-known living artist. </p>
