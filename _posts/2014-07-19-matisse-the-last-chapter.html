<p>“People are like stained-glass windows,” Doctor Elisabeth Kübler-Ross once opined, “They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.”  This statement reflects Henri Matisse’s cut-out designs for his stained glass windows.  Although Matisse is remembered for his innovative paintings and brilliant use of color, his cut-outs are lesser known.  His majestic use of color and light culminate in the cut-out designs he created for stained glass windows.</p>

<p><em>Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs</em> denotes Matisse’s final chapter in his vast career, when he began “carving into color.”  This comprehensive retrospective at Tate Modern, which debuts in October at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, brings together approximately 120 Matisse’s cut-out collages from 1936 through 1954.  Film footage and photographs accompany the cut-outs, exposing the process.  Indeed, entering this exhibition connotes stepping into the artist’s studio.</p>  

<p>Confined primarily to a wheelchair after a cancer treatment in 1941, Matisse’s poor health prevented him from painting.  But this condition did not dampen his attitude, vigor and creativity;  Matisse referred to his later years as “a second life.”  With large scissors in hand and the aid of assistants, Matisse created cut-out paper collages called <em>gouaches d&#233;coup&#233;s</em>.  An opportunity to “paint with scissors,” as Matisse put it, his cut-outs exude movement, freedom and experimentation through the simple act of cutting.  The exhibition displays some of Matisse’s most famous pieces, including <em>The Parakeet and the Mermaid</em> and his famous <em>Blue Nudes</em>.  His stained glass windows, however, are particularly moving: combining light, color, art and spirituality.</p>

<p>One notable example includes his work for the Dominican Chapel of the Rosary in Vence.  Sister Jacques approached Matisse in 1947 to design one stained glass window.  The project soon turned into a decorative plan for the chapel itself, including priestly garments, objects and windows.  Referring to this ambitious project, Matisse stated: “This work required me 4 years of an exclusive and entiring effort and it is the fruit of my whole working life.  In spite of all its imperfections I consider it as my masterpiece.”</p>

<p>What makes this project so grand?  It reveals Matisse’s key attributes as an artist, particularly the relationship between color and light.  Being bound to a wheelchair did not inhibit Matisse’s creativity.  Working around his confines, he used a long bamboo “wand” to enable him to work at ground level.  The exhibition notes that Matisse used cut-outs to imagine his designs transformed into glass.  What is more, he turned his studio, and later bedroom, into a model chapel in order to understand the different elements he was designing; the exhibition gallery provides a similar experience.  The priestly garments and stained-glass window cut-out designs fill the walls of the space, creating an encapsulating environment, filled with energy and movement.</p> 

<p>Matisse’s stained glass work did not stop in Vence.  There are other examples, notably his <em>Nuit de Noel</em> commissioned for the Time-Life building in New York.  The window and its marquette are displayed together at the end of the exhibition. “Matisse described the maquette for <em>Nuit de Noel</em> as being like a musical score, while the stained glass window was like a symphony orchestra,” Nicholas Serota, the Tate and exhibition co-curator, declared. “Nuit de Noel is an astonishing creation celebrating the ‘joy of life’ by an artist in his eighties.”  Despite his health issues, Matisse’s cut-outs express his zest for life and acute attention to color and light.  His stained glass windows are a lasting reminder of these very facts.</p> 

<p>Elegance and fluidity radiate from the cut-outs from afar, suggestive that Matisse’s scissors sailed through the paper with grace and ease.  Yet his acute attention to mental and physical processes demonstrate these cut-outs are more than simply cut pieces of paper.  “I cut out these gouache sheets the way you cut glass: only here they’re organized to reflect lights, whereas in a stained-glass window they have to be arranged differently because light shines through them,” Matisse remarked in regards to his designs for <em>Jazz</em>.  Close examination also unveils many pin holes indicating the working and reworking of each layer.  Matisse relied on his assistants, who climbed ladders and positioned and repositioned the cut out pieces under his direction.</p> 

<p>Although famous for paintings such as <em>Woman with a Hat</em> or L<em>andscape at Collioure</em>, Matisse’s stained-glass windows exemplify the skill and thought process of an art master, and proved perfect tasks for Matisse in his later years.  Stained glass radiates beauty, but it also reveals incredible consideration for color and light in its design.  Matisse’s stained glass window designs are not only permanent reminders of this eminent artist, but also underscore his permanence in the history of art.</p>
