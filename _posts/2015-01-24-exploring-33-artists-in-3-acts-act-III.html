<p><em>In November 2014 Sarah Thornton, a writer and sociologist of art, published a book in the United States titled, “33 Artists in 3 Acts.” It will be released in many translations in 2015. Since this book is relevant for discussion, I will publish a series of posts to examine its arguments and highlight its contributions.  You can read the previous entries for: the <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/33-artists-in-3-acts-introduction/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a>, <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/exploring-33-artists-in-3-acts-act-I/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Act I" target="_blank">Act I: Politics</a> and <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/exploring-33-artists-in-3-acts-act-II/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Act II" target="_blank">Act II: Kinship</a>.  Today we investigate Act III: Craft.</em></p>

<p>Sarah Thornton turns to craft in Act III.  Before jumping into the details, here is an overview of what’s been covered so far.  Since the definition of an artist has changed over time, this book sets out to explore the question: What is an artist?  Act I: Politics explores attitudes towards power, ethics and freedom of speech; Act II: Kinship analyzes artists’ relationships.  Act III: Craft brings together the entire process of making a work of art and crafting an artistic identity. With so much latitude in the realm of art, along with the changed role of the artist, Ms. Thornton takes readers on a fascinating journey to uncover an answer to her posed question.</p>

<p>About a third of her book is devoted to craft.  This word can initially spark thoughts of skillfully creating a handmade object.  But Act III examines craft through a contemporary lens.  It is a definition that changes in the eyes of each artist Ms. Thornton interviews.  Readers learn that American performance artist Andrea Fraser sees the whole process&mdash;researching, writing, editing, memorizing, practicing and acting&mdash;as part of her craft.  In contrast, English artist Damien Hirst uses assistants to produce his “still lives.”  This approach recalls Jeff Koons, the American artist examined in Act I, who has also used assistants to produce art.  Critically, Messrs Hirst and Koons reveal that artists do not need to physically craft an object themselves.  Rather, the conceptualization of an artwork is just as important.  As Grayson Perry, an English artist known for his pottery, explained in his interview with Ms. Thornton: “I can teach someone to make my last artwork but not my next one.”</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>The main point is that craft takes on many dimensions.  More than creating a tangible object or generating ideas for one, artists also craft their identities.  How an artist presents him or herself and the multiple roles they play impact the brands they create.  Previous Acts explain that Maurizio Cattelan makes unique tee-shirts to “customize” his appearance, whereas Jeff Koons can be found looking dapper in a suit.  But it is also worthy to consider artists’ activities and responsibilities as it relates to their identities.  Ms. Thornton explains that Mr. Perry is a marked ceramist who also makes tapestries and sculptures alongside writing and presenting on television programs.  He is not alone.  Other artists are professors or have additional jobs alongside the many extracurricular activities involved with being an artist: interviewing, participating in talks, attending biennales and openings and collaborating with other artists.  Unlike many professions, artists do not have to conform; they create their artwork and themselves.</p>

<p>So what are the book's main contributions?  There are many.  In short: it is not only what Ms. Thornton does through the course of this book, but how she does it.  First, she tackles an apt question in art today: What is an artist?  How she presents her research makes for a captivating read, which is the second contribution.</p>

<p>Ms. Thornton engages readers by vividly recounting her artist interviews.  As she sets foot into Maurizio Cattelan's apartment or Beatriz Milhazes’s studio, the reader imaginatively follows.  Ms. Thornton seamlessly interweaves background, biographical and artwork analysis to support these interviews.  Readers implicitly compare and contrast artists&mdash;a construct that leaves them wanting to know more.</p>

<p>Third, by the end of each Act, readers “know” the characters (artists), albeit on a different level.  Ms. Thornton supplies readers with intimate aspects of an artist’s life&mdash;their studio, house or childhood details&mdash;as well as their role within the artworld and attitudes towards other artists.  These details are more than interesting facts.  This information helps shape opinions about what an artist is today: from how ideas are conceived and why, towards the means of production.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading <em>33 Artists in 3 Acts</em> and thinking through its major themes and contributions.  I hope other readers gain insights from this book, as I have.</p>
