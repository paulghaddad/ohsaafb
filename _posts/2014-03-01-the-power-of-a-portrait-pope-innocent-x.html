    <p>Yan Pei-Ming, an established Chinese artist living in France, says: &ldquo;Portrait is like a mirror, it reflects to us who we are, what we are.&rdquo;  Mr. Yan is recognized for his large-scale portraits of world leaders and cultural icons, including Pope John Paul II, President Barack Obama, Mao Zedong, Bruce Lee and Pablo Picasso.  Mr. Yan keeps with a similar motif in his second solo exhibition at Massimo De Carlo gallery in London, England, <em>Innocent</em>, which displays fifteen replications of the eminent painting, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, by Diego Vel&aacute;zquez (circa 1649-1650).</p>    

    <p>The Spanish-born painter, Diego Vel&aacute;zquez, is admired as one of the greatest European artists.  He was not only a court painter for King Philip IV, but also the only painter in Rome at the time allowed to paint the Pope, which he accomplished during his second trip to Italy between 1649-1650.  His famous portrait, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, exemplifies what Vel&aacute;zquez is most remembered for today: the ability to convey a sense of truth and realism.  The Pope&rsquo;s facial features are lifelike&mdash;the scowl in his eye, pursed lips and ruffled brow.  Furthermore, the beautiful red satin that cloaks the Pope demonstrates Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s sensuous paint handling.  The personae of Pope Innocent X comes alive as he sits enthroned in his royal garments with an unyielding glare directed towards the viewer&mdash;a motif that Mr. Yan also uses in his iterations of the same subject.</p>

    <p>Of the three galleries depicting Yan Pei-Ming&rsquo;s portraits at Massimo De Carlo, the ground floor gallery is the most alluring.  Two huge portraits of Pope Innocent X flank the end walls, interspersed with smaller versions of the same.  The white walls crowned with dentil molding on the ceiling and the chandelier lighting adds to the ambiance.  The many grandiose images of the Pope, combined with the elegance of the gallery, underscore the entrance into a dignified space, fitting for a renowned pope and patron.  However, Mr. Yan seemingly transforms this elegance into a claustrophobic and tense atmosphere by repeatedly depicting the glare that Vel&aacute;zquez originally captured centuries ago.  The eyes of all eight representations of the Pope are directed towards the viewer, who is self-consciously drawn into a narrative with a changed role: from voyeur to subject.  The hierarchical relationship is repeatedly emphasized in each instance&mdash;a juxtaposition that addresses the issue of domination and the weakness of humanity.</p>

    <p>The power dimension is just one of the possible unfolding narratives in this exhibition, another includes Mr. Yan's artistic process. Despite keeping the position of the Pope consistent throughout, the subtle differences demonstrates Mr. Yan&rsquo;s painterly process: the rapid brushstrokes of oil paint, various canvas dimensions and range of colors.  For example, each image portrays the Pope&rsquo;s hands in a different position&mdash;clasped; opened; pointing.  In this way, Mr. Yan&rsquo;s process is similar to Andy Warhol&rsquo;s, who used repetition in many of his works, including his images of commodities and celebrities.  In both cases, the repetition tacitly calls the viewer to examine the subtle nuances, which emphasizes the means of creation. </p>

    <p>Mr. Yan is not the first artist to replicate Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s image.  Francis Bacon also used this seminal painting as inspiration for his <em>Study After Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s Portrait of Pope Innocent X</em> (1953).  Instead of a regal representation, Bacon examines the psychological depth of the individual.  Using rapid brushstrokes, Bacon captures the emotional turmoil of modern life: the Pope grips his throne with his mouth wide-open, screaming.  The dark color palette, purple and black, coincides with this emotional message.  Although Mr. Yan&rsquo;s versions of the same subject is visually less alarming, his painterly style is noteworthy: the rapid brushstrokes, extending beyond any drawn confines, combined with thick layers of paint, implies the emotional state of the artist&mdash;rather than the sitter. Bacon&rsquo;s title proves influential: the word <em>study</em> indicates the process of painting, an ubiquitous theme throughout Mr. Yan&rsquo;s exhibition.</p>

    <p>Replicating Diego Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s highly regarded portrait, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, which also inspired the famous twentieth-century artist, Francis Bacon, implies a host of ideas on behalf of Mr. Yan: elevating oneself to that of an established art great, self-confidence and authority.  Mr. Yan uses Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s eminent portrait to comment on today&rsquo;s authorities, and consequently, the meager role of the populace, as well as the process of painting itself.  There is power in the use of repetition, particularly that of a painted portrait.  The painting style and the sitter conveys a plethora of information&mdash;history, power, emotional state, and psychology of the self&mdash;and therefore, <em>Innocent</em> demonstrates the age-old adage that indeed, &ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words.&rdquo;</p>
