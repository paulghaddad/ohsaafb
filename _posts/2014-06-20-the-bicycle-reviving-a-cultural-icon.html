<p>China’s outdoor air pollution contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010.  To improve its air quality, China’s recent policy document plans to take more than six million older vehicles off of the road this year.  But car exhaust may not even be the root of the problem.  A 2013 Chinese Academy of Sciences study found industrial pollution as the culprit of Beijing’s smog.  Since car exhaust and the burning of trash accounted for only 4% of this problem, vehicle reduction may allude to a different aim&mdash;the return to a Chinese cultural icon.</p>

<p>This policy will force millions of people to find alternative modes of transportation.  The already crowded public transit, such as the subway, is one option; the bicycle is another.  Millions already ride a bicycle in China.  And with this new policy, millions more could be too&mdash;if people can move beyond the stigma in China associated with bike riding today.</p>

<p>Once a symbol of luxury in its own right, the bicycle served as the primary mode of transportation before China modernized.  This cultural icon was downgraded to an item used by the poor in the early 1980s; no longer a sign of luxury, the bicycle represented backwardness.  As the Chinese have become richer, they have turned their likes from bikes to cars&mdash;a symbol of status and wealth.  And thus, Chinese contemporary artist, Ai Weiwei, addresses the bicycle’s cultural significance in his <em>Forever</em> series.</p>

<p>Mr. Ai presents three new bicycle installations as part of the <em>Forever</em> series at Lisson Gallery in London.  The exhibition incorporates three stainless-steel bicycle configurations, composed of different modular shapes.  The bicycles reference the famous ‘Forever’ brand that has been mass-produced in China since 1940.  Mr. Ai explains that owning a bicycle once had a privileged  status and a reputation of being durable, practical and strong for countryside roads.  Although the cultural attitude towards bicycles changed over 30 years ago, could perception towards Chinese symbols and heritage be changing once again?  The arts and the vehicle reduction policy suggest so.</p>

<p>The repatriation of arts in China has been prevalent in recent years.  Fiammetta Rocco and Sarah Thornton argue: “Prevented for so long from celebrating achievements of their forebears, they [the Chinese] have a thirst for their own history, and especially for anything that connects modern China with the glories of its imperial past.”  Repatriation is not only a desire to reclaim lost treasures.  It is also a return to traditional Chinese themes in contemporary art, including landscapes and calligraphy.  Given this return to Chinese themes in art, revisiting the once emblematic bicycle is a cultural example of China reclaiming its heritage.</p>

<p>Mr. Ai’s bicycle installations at Lisson Gallery are paradoxical: a mode of transportation has been frozen and made immobile.  A once functional object is now useless: literally, as the tires are missing and all that is left is the shiny shell of the object; and figuratively, since the car has replaced this once ubiquitous item.  Mr. Ai remembers and pays tribute to this past cultural icon by monumentalizing it, conceivably prophesying its revived cultural status.</p>

<p>Mr. Ai is famous for recycling historical moments in China, and often creates loaded messages in the process.  <em>Fragments</em>, for example, is an installation that includes salvaged wood from Qing Dynasty temples.  Although Mr. Ai’s reputation has been associated with controversy, this outspoken artist appears to commemorate a past Chinese symbol&mdash;the bicycle&mdash;in his <em>Forever</em> series.</p>

<p>Coinciding with the announcement of China’s new transportation plans, Mr. Ai’s exhibition comes at a perfect time.  The motivation for the vehicle removal policy appears to be unrealistic in solving China’s pollution problem&mdash;if this is indeed the real intent.  The removal of six million vehicles pales in comparison to the 240 million vehicles already on Chinese roads.  Since research suggests car exhaust is not even the cause of Beijing’s pollution problem, this policy may be an opportunity to reclaim the Western invention and once privileged Chinese object: the bicycle.</p>
