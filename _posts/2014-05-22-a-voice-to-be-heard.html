<p>Journalist Masih Alinejad recently created a Facebook page, “Stealthy Freedoms of Iranian Women,” revealing Iranian women without their hijab.  Ostensibly simple, innocent photos of women by the seaside or driving in the car are not only creating media hype, but also causing cultural debate.  The facial expression and body language of women without the traditional Muslim female covering suggests a desire for liberation.  Ms. Alinejad explains:</p>

<blockquote>“I have no intention whatsoever to encourage people to defy the forced hijab or stand up against it.  I just want to give voice to thousands and thousands of Iranian women who think they have no platform to have their say.”</blockquote>

<p>Receiving over 200,000 “likes” on Facebook, Ms. Alinejad has inspired thousands of Iranian women to take pictures of themselves without a hijab.  The photographs are powerful, and give rise to the adage, “Actions speak louder than words.”  Photographs of Iranian women with hair blowing in the wind and smiles across their faces illustrate a new found freedom.</p>

<p>It became illegal for Iranian women to leave the house without the hijab following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  Iranian women risk punishment from the patrolling morality police if they are caught without a head covering in public.  Indeed, the overwhelming success of Ms. Alinejad’s page gives Iranian women a space to be themselves, and to independently decide whether or not to wear a hijab.</p>

<p>Using visual form to give a voice to the voiceless is a common means of expression for Iranian women today.  Photorealist artist, Afshin Pirhashemi, follows this construct in his exhibition at Ayyam Gallery, <em>Seduction</em>, by illustrating the power of non-verbal communication.  This paradoxical exhibition title incites notions of sexuality to draw the viewer in viscerally, only to communicate intellectually.  Beyond the physical beauty of the female body, the psychological depth in the exhibition’s eleven oil on canvas pieces is revealed.  Consequently, this exhibition is not about physical beauty.  Mr. Pirhashemi’s real interest is the complex female role in contemporary Iran.</p>

<p>Depicted individually or in small groups, the women in Mr. Pirhashemi’s images project inner beauty: radiating self-assurance and independence.  <em>Mothers</em> is one exhibition image that exemplifies this changing course for Iranian woman.  The visual iconography is at odds with the title.  While the traditional role of women may have been motherhood, this image suggests how this notion is changing.  Instead of&mdash;or in addition to&mdash;motherhood, the body language alludes to a changed reality.  The direct eye contact and erect posture of seven women, cloaked in black and clustered together in a semicircle, exude confidence.  The heads and hair of several figures are revealed, denoting the aspired freedom of being uncovered.  And the three centrally placed women with swords drawn indicates a willingness to fight for their rights: for a changed societal order.</p>

<p>This quest for a new society is not without trepidation.  Two women on each end hold masks to their faces.  Their inclusion implies freedom sought, but repercussions feared when disrupting a hierarchical society.  Yet, these women are depicted together&mdash;including their fears, emotions and ambitions&mdash;to project the power of a group.</p>

<p>And together these women are placed prominently in the foreground, making their presence known.  The deep black of their clothing, hints of color in their faces and swords add to this distinction; men on horses, resembling antiquity figures, float in the background.  This juxtaposition implies that Iranian women are establishing themselves in a male-dominated society.  The wants, desires and challenges these women face are reinforced in a nearby image, <em>God Bless</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Pirhashemi blends nonverbal and verbal modes of communication in <em>God Bless</em> to convey messages about contemporary Iranian women.  The sole female figure depicted in this black and white image boldly confronts the male gaze with her piercing eyes.  Her facial features&mdash;strong jawline, pierced lips and unyielding stare&mdash;make fierce eye contact with the viewer; her body language&mdash;hands behind her head and her elbows protruding horizontally into the viewer’s space&mdash;are non-verbal cues that represent an independent, strong woman.  Depicted without a hijab reinforces Zarmina Rafi’s argument that “Pirhashemi’s women . . . are makers of meaning in their own right.” </p>

<p>The intense visual language, combined with the six handwritten phrases, underscores the 
challenges and mental turmoil this young woman faces.  Phrases such as, “no job,” “can’t speak” and “God bless,” are handwritten one after another—a laundry list of problems.  Written in English, this appears to be a message for the Western world: to see, read and understand the inequalities that still exist today.  Mr. Pirhashemi’s fusion of the verbal and nonverbal calls attention to the problems of contemporary Iranian culture and the changes seek: giving the once silent female a voice.</p>

<p>Ms. Alinejad and Mr. Pirhashemi demonstrate the power of the visual.  Although Ms. Alinejad is known for being critical of the Iranian government, she claims that her Facebook page is not political.  She argues that “these are not women activists, but just ordinary women talking from their hearts."  Far from submissive, these strong, independent Iranian women portrayed photographically on Ms. Alinejad’s Facebook page and pictorially in Mr. Pirhashemi’s exhibition confront the viewer.  By visually amplifying the longing for change, these seemingly once silent voices are now heard.</p>
