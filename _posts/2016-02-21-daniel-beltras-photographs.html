<p>Daniel Beltr&#225;’s exhibition, “Ice/Green Lands,” at Catherine Edelman Gallery
is delightful.  Upon entering the gallery, I swiftly transitioned from urban life
in Chicago to the stunning, far-off worlds of Greenland and Iceland.  The
fifteen exhibited works consist of aerial photographs of Greenland and Iceland.
They exemplify the natural beauty the world offers, which is why the show
grips us.  It is also why, as I walked around gawking, I
realized the exhibition is particularly relevant today.</p>

<p>Upon entering the gallery you have your pick of images, all of which are
equally radiant. The brilliant turquoise water juxtaposed with white snow in “Greenland 2” is
striking.  The beauty lures me close, though I was unsure what I was looking at
initially.  Each image is abstract.  You do not see sweeping landscapes from a
distance, but rather detailed aerial shots.  My eye traced the crevices of
Iceland’s rocky terrain in “Iceland 15,” and the snaking icy-blue waterways in
“Greenland 10.”</p>

<p>The titles of Beltr&#225;’s photographs are not descriptive.  Other than knowing
the geographical location, Iceland or Greenland, you have little contextual
information about the exact site.  This ambiguity seems purposeful, though,
because it gets you thinking and looking a little longer.  Inevitably, you
derive at the larger narrative—that is, the ecological concerns governing our
world.</p>

<p>Beltr&#225; turns to aerial photography to help “emphasize that the Earth and its
resources are finite.” It is a conclusion I came to as well.  There is a lot of interest in climate change and global warming in art and politics right now, as demonstrated in late 2015 by the Conference of Parties (COP21), a climate change conference. Coinciding with the COP21 in Paris, artist Olafur Eliasson and professor Minik
Rosing debuted their “Ice Watch” installation in Paris, which included twelve blocks
of ice from Greenland.</p>

<p>Beltr&#225; and Eliasson address the same issue, but they differ in their means.
Instead of shocking visitors with melting blocks of ice, Beltr&#225;’s photographs
take time to uncover.  Eventually reality surpasses aesthetic appeal.  After
studying Beltr&#225;’s images, you consider what may happen to the crystal clear
water cutting through Iceland’s rugged terrain, or the snow that is sadly
melting away in Greenland.  Once the reality of the situation sets in, the
images at once seem to exclaim: “This is what our world is losing.  Do
something!”</p>

<p>Will the beauty remain?  Only time will tell.  But Beltr&#225;’s show vividly demonstrates what we stand to lose if action is not taken.</p>

<cite>“Ice/Green Lands” is on show at Catherine Edelman Gallery until March 5.</cite>
