<p><em>In November 2014 Sarah Thornton, a writer and sociologist of art, published a book in the United States titled, “33 Artists in 3 Acts.” It will be released in many translations in 2015. Since this book is relevant for discussion, I will publish a series of posts to examine its arguments and highlight its contributions.  You can read the first entry <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/33-artists-in-3-acts-introduction/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Introduction" target="_blank">here</a>.  The remaining posts will examine each “Act” that governs Ms. Thornton’s book: Act I: Politics; Act II: Kinship; Act III: Craft.  Each Act includes individual “scenes.”  Today Act 1: Politics is explored.</em></p>

<p>Act I begins with Ms. Thornton recounting her experience hearing American artist Jeff Koons speak at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London.  Opening with Mr. Koons is a useful starting point, since he paradoxically embodies the political theme as an artist.  Although he portrays a non-political persona in order to appeal to the masses, his diverse subjects can be deemed controversial in the eyes of many.  The way Mr. Koons crafts his identity, or brand, based on how he wants to be perceived, points to an overarching theme in the book: being a professional artist today.</p>

<p>Ms. Thornton then pins Chinese artist Ai Weiwei against Mr. Koons beginning in Scene 2 and throughout the rest of Act I, a strategy she explains in her introduction.  This tactic is employed again in Act III: placing American performance artist Andrea Fraser in opposition to English artist Damien Hirst.  The middle Act, however, under the theme of kinship, reveals artists’ relationships in the art world.  A family (Laurie Simmons, her husband, Carroll Dunham, and their two daughters) is paired with Cindy Sherman and Maurizio Cattelan, among other art world individuals.  This approach implicitly asks readers to compare and contrast disparate artists under the same theme&mdash;an intentional goal and distinct aspect of the book.  In this way, Ms. Thornton does not explicitly define what “political” means to her.  Rather, she gives many examples for readers to draw their own conclusions about artists of a similar age practicing in countries around the world.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Indeed, an engaging practice of Ms. Thornton’s is her storytelling methodology: recounting her interviews with artists that make up each scene.  This is quite helpful.  The reader visualizes each unfolding interaction, as if they were alongside Eugenio Dittborn in his Santiago, Chili, studio; with Kutlug Ataman at the Istanbul Biennial; or beside Jeff Koons preparing for a gallery opening at Frankfurt’s Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung Museum.  This strategy provides readers with nuanced information, from artists’ responsibilities in the art world to childhood conflicts that haunt them to this day.  More than a voyeuristic indulgence of artists’ lives, readers gather new details about these individuals and their work.  Consequently, we see these artists anew, even familiar ones.  Ms. Thornton provides enough information to learn, inform and stimulate questions.  Chief among them is: What is an artist today?  Answering this question is part of the fun for the reader.</p>

<p>As it appears to be for Ms. Thornton: she interjects humor at points, along with an artist’s biographical information, artwork and historical context.  This ancillary information helps shape the reader’s opinion to the “what is an artist” question, which may also be influenced by the vastly different responses from the artists interviewed&mdash;an intriguing aspect of the book.  Answers reflect how artists view themselves, their work and role in the broader art world: from feeling the responsibility to open minds and expand contexts to advocating freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Ms. Thornton includes a variety of artists in Act I and throughout the book: originating from Santiago, Chile, to Istanbul, Turkey, and many countries in between.  Doing so underscores how the artist’s role has changed, and elucidates the roles artists play today in a global art world.  Although the final version of this book features fewer than 33 artists (Ms. Thornton notes that Gertrude Stein’s <em>Four Saints in Three Acts</em> (1934) “features some twenty saints and more than three acts”), the diversity of the artists included demonstrates how an artist’s origins and cultural expectations embrace this political theme.</p>

<p>Readers uncover how an artist’s sense of place, in terms of current locale or childhood upbringing, influences their work.  A few of the many examples of Act I include Ai Weiwei, who lives in Communist China, takes an activist role as an artist; Tammy Rae Carland, an American artist, had an impoverished childhood and derives the fictions she creates from her social world; and another American artist, Martha Rosler, protests the Vietnam War and comments on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in <em>House Beautiful: Bringing the War Home</em> (1967 and 1972; 2004 and 2008, respectively).</p>

<p>The artworks that make up this first section embrace class issues, activism, homosexuality, war and censorship, among other political topics.  These point toward broader political themes; power, responsibility, rights and freedom of speech are overarching ideas that shape Act I, Ms. Thornton explains.  Indeed, bringing together artists from around the world that embrace a similar theme in different ways reveals the malleability of the term, politics.</p>

<p>Next week, we investigate Act II: Kinship . . .</p>
