<p class=no-indent><em>Pedro Cabrita Reis, the draughtsman.</em></p>

<p>Ideas of painting may be an afterthought when standing amidst an installation with seven three-dimensional aluminum beams zigzagging across a gallery.  But Portuguese artist Pedro Cabrita Reis states that he is a painter in an interview with David Batchelor.  According to Cabrita Reis, the way he uses materials, including neon tubes, plaster, steel and glass, reflect painting’s lexicon: transparency, opacity, light and verticality.  Immersion into his current exhibition at The Arts Club of Chicago, <em>A few lines, a facade inside and a possible staircase</em>, points to another artistic characteristic: that of a draughtsman.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, Cabrita Reis began working with installation.  One of his known works includes <em>a remote whisper</em>, from the 2013 Venice Biennale.  The fluorescent lights, free-hanging black electrical cords and aluminum bars interrupting the gallery space in Venice are also used in his current installation, <em>7 lines (Chicago)</em>, in addition to the six other pieces of various media occupying the first floor of The Arts Club.</p>

<p>Given the emphasis on line and attention to architecture and space, Cabrita Reis’s draughtsmanship abounds in his Chicago exhibition.  <em>7 lines (Chicago)</em> packs the biggest punch of the pieces on show.  Seven rectangular aluminum beams partially covered with fluorescent lights stretch across the gallery floor: one end is precariously propped on a small cubed stone block; the other leans against the gallery wall at an angle.  Seen as lines cutting through the visitors’ space, the physicality of the beams generate bodily awareness and tacitly direct gallery movement.  Visitors gingerly weave among the diagonal lines, and silently contemplate the repercussions of a mis-step.  Tellingly, architectural materials overlooked in another context are intensified here.</p>

<p><em>7 lines (Chicago)</em> is placed in a gallery that includes multiple windows with views of downtown Chicago.  It is hard not to think about the built environment in this space&mdash;but in a new way.  Together, the lines that make up this installation and the city views recall the drawings and lines that preconceived a city renowned for its architecture.  The fluorescent lights and daylight streaming in from the windows reflect the long beams on the gallery’s shiny black floor, amplifying the line motif.</p>

<p>Cabrita Reis’s installation recalls the work of American sculptor, Teresita Fernández.  Despite her reputation for working with sculpture, Ms. Fernández’s work is rooted in drawing.  “Fernández’s sculptures are like drawings writ large,” as Gregory Volk, a critic and curator, puts it in his essay, “Current Sublime: On the Work of Teresita Fernández.”  “[She] persuades her viewers to concentrate on surface activity, exactly as you would with drawings.”  Ms. Fernández, moreover, sees drawing as an extension of thinking, which is also echoed in Cabrita Reis’s work&mdash;the underpinnings of architecture.</p>

<p>Other pieces in the exhibition use line differently and less intrusively than <em>7 lines (Chicago)</em>. <em>The Tape Drawings #2 (New York)</em> is the only piece that implies the hand of the artist: torn paper and hand-drawn circles.  Despite being confined to a frame, the imperfections suggest the artist’s thought process.  <em>One down (Chicago)</em> is also a nod to the built environment: lines of alloy steel are adhered to the wall and placed side by side.</p>

<p>Chicago is architecturally famous. Aside from numerous skyscrapers that line the streets of downtown, there are a few notable architectural examples in the city and surrounding area.  Frank Lloyd Wright’s home and studio are located in Chicago, as are some of the houses he designed; Mies van der Rohe’s Farnsworth House, a glass house in Plano, Illinois, is a quintessential example of modern architecture.  Indeed, Cabrita Reis’s exhibition is apt for a city with such a rich architectural history.  To that end, simple industrial materials found in this exhibition tell a powerful story in an experiential way: drawing is a fundamental activity that binds art and architecture. Cabrita Reis may call himself a painter, yet he appears to be a draughtsman at heart.</p>
