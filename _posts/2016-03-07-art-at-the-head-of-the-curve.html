<p class="no-indent"><em>Virtual reality has the potential to upend life as we
  know it. The art industry shows us how.</em></p>

<p>“Artists once feared that photography would kill painting,” English art
historian, Francis Haskell, once observed. Although painting is still alive,
photography did affect it. Consider painters influenced by photography, from
Edgar Degas to Gerhard Richter. The apprehension towards technology 
evoked by photography has been displaced today: the art industry is among the
early adopters of virtual reality (VR).</p>

<p>People often talk about the potential of VR, but artists and art institutions
are putting words to practice. Take “Alternate Reality,” artist Gretchen
Andrew’s aptly titled 2015 exhibition at De Re Gallery in Los Angeles. With only
three physical paintings displayed, visitors donned a VR headset to see some
twelve additional works, while also learning about Andrew’s artistic process
through narration. Whereas Andrew’s exhibition revealed the possibilities of VR,
artist Rachel Rossin’s 2015 exhibition, “Lossy,” at Zieher Smith &amp; Horton,
consisting of oil paintings and VR headsets, suggested how our physical and virtual worlds
are colliding. Both exhibitions not only demonstrate a new means to see and
experience art. They also imply the convergence of two industries—both artists
have backgrounds in technology.</p>


<p>Art institutions are also catching on. The Courtauld Gallery in London paired
with WoofbertVR, a creator of immersive art educational content. According to
<em>Techcrunch</em>, visitors can download the WoofbertVR app and use Samsung Gear VR to
view the Wolfson room in the museum; users then hear a narration discussing
paintings by Renoir, Monet and Manet, among other notable artists. Last year,
the British Museum and Samsung, a museum partner, debuted a “Virtual Reality
Weekend”: visitors wore VR headsets to explore scans of Bronze Age objects in
3D.</p>

<p>Art museums face challenges in the 21st century; changing demographics and
economic shifts are among them. With a need to stay relevant, a call for
institutional change could be the impetus for the art industry’s interest in VR.
It is a tool that can reach larger audiences, enabling more people to see and
experience art like never before. VR also offers practical solutions. Ms.
Andrew’s exhibition was primarily virtual, enabling De Re Gallery to have a
second, physical exhibition taking place at the same time. Above all, artists
and institutions are finding that VR offers novel possibilities for art, as
photography did for painting.</p>
