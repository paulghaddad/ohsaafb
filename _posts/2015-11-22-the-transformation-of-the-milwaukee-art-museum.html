<p>The renovations and addition at the Milwaukee Art Museum (MAM), one of the nation’s oldest, are both dynamic and refreshing; excitement has been growing as the November 24 reopening nears.  The six year, $34 million project includes the re-envisioning of its Collection Galleries and structural updates to the MAM’s Eero Saarinen-designed War Memorial Center and David Kahler-designed extension, along with a new east entry addition.  These changes enhance visitor flow and allow 2,500 artworks to be displayed within these spaces from the Museum’s 30,000 piece collection.</p>

<p>Experience is a repeated theme throughout the MAM’s history and its current project.  The Museum’s 1957 War Memorial Center was built to commemorate those who served in the World Wars.  Instead of a statue, “it was built as an experience,” Daniel Keegan, Director at MAM, explains.  The 1975 Kahler addition originally included an east end “glass curtain wall,” as Chief Curator Brady Roberts describes it, which was “blocked off” over time in order to create additional galleries and to safeguard the art.  That said, beyond structural repairs, the project aimed to reconnect the Museum with views of Lake Michigan, and to create a more flowing floor plan.  In short, “we wanted to fundamentally change the experience with the art,” Keegan says.</p>

<p>Although there is a prevailing west to east flow, the new layout is also flexible&mdash;leaving it to the viewer to wander and explore.  And they do.  The open spaces facilitate free movement: visitors transition between galleries with ease.  Once in a gallery, the space itself reflects the artwork displayed.  Many Old Master works are placed in domestic-styled rooms with warm-colored walls; Contemporary Art can be found in “white cube” spaces.</p>

<p>While perusing the Museum’s collection and new acquisitions found throughout, visitors cannot miss several chief improvements.  First is “The Herzfeld Center for Photography and Media Arts,” a 10,000 square-foot space devoted to photography and other light based media in the Museum’s lower level.  The opening exhibition features pieces from the MAM’s photography collection, including works by Alfred Stieglitz, Lorna Simpson, Stephen Shore and Walker Evans.  Visitors can expect future shows of Rineke Dijkstra’s work and that of emerging artists.</p>

<p>Walking between levels, visitors also notice the “Kohl’s Art Generation: <em>Rubbish!</em>” gallery, an interactive space geared towards kids and their families.  It features art by trained and untrained artists, and demonstrates how art can be made out of anything&mdash;even discarded materials, according to Brigid Globensky, Head of Education at the MAM.  Visitors can explore existing artworks by Deborah Butterfield and Clarence and Grace Woolsey; they can also work on their own masterpiece.  The central placement of this space within the museum suggests physical, active engagement with art, alongside intellectual, but passive viewing in neighboring galleries.</p>

<p>The third enhancement worth noting is the east-end addition.  According to Roberts, it’s where “the city grid meets the organic lines of the lakefront.”  Indeed, it nearly borders Lake Michigan itself.  This addition not only offers a lakefront entrance for visitors, but also invites them to enjoy art and nature in a new way.  A select number of artworks fill its upper galleries, complemented by breathtaking views of Lake Michigan and the surrounding landscape.  Plush furniture encourages visitors to sit, relax and enjoy the art and views.  The environment is welcoming, and inspires visitors to linger a little longer.</p>

<p>Daniel Keegan says that “in many ways we have transformed the museum.”  They have, and by doing so the MAM has enhanced the visitor’s experience.  Now the Museum’s three architectural buildings&mdash;the renovated Saarinen and Kahler-designed buildings and Santiago Calatrava-designed Quadracci Pavilion&mdash;flow seamlessly together.  The galleries within the Saarinen and Kahler buildings are reconfigured, enabling visitors to better see and experience some of the Museum’s laudable collection.  Their Contemporary collection alone includes pieces by Yinka Shonibare, Robert Smithson and Gerhard Richter.</p>

<p>Such changes make the Museum easier to navigate and more instinctive.  Within the renovated spaces, hints of lakefront views are occasionally seen from a distance, functioning as a guidepost for visitors.  Adding to this, Roberts points out that the mezzanine offers “great vistas,” so visitors can look out in multiple directions and see great art.  To that end, the Milwaukee Art Museum achieved its transformatory aim by bettering the visitor’s experience.  It’s worth a trip to see the “new” MAM; you won’t be disappointed.</p>
