<p class=no-indent><em>The Art Institute of Chicago displays two pieces by artist Wade Guyton in an installation that is as much about seeing art as it is about experiencing it.</em></p>

<p>Two works by post-conceptualist artist Wade Guyton occupy gallery 291 at the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC).  A life-size replica of a coat-check counter is juxtaposed with a large black and white inkjet print on linen.  Both pieces not only share the same name, <em>Untitled</em>.  Together, they also yield an experience for visitors.</p>

<p>Mr. Guyton is known for his images produced with an inkjet printer from digital files.  One of the two <em>Untitled</em> (2014) pieces on view is such a work.  This inkjet image hangs across from the second <em>Untitled</em> (2014) piece on view: the replica counter.  Two disparate pieces sharing an ambiguous name raise more questions than provide answers, which may be the point.  It is an installation seemingly based on the viewer’s experience: calling attention to the process of experiencing art in a specific context.</p>
 
<p>Visitors entering the gallery gravitate towards the counter, and understandably so.  Its size, a large imposing wooden beam, and placement create a presence in the room that lures people in.  Furthermore, the counter’s importance is underscored by the cement blocks that elevate it.  Suggestive of a plinth, these blocks monumentalize the counter.  Perhaps most important is the counter’s central position.  It has a critical impact on the visitor’s footpath in the gallery: calling attention to the sculpture by forcing people to walk around it.  The ample space surrounding the counter denotes an installation designed with the visitor in mind.  Walking around it is an opportunity to experience the counter and the area in which it resides, while also offering another means to see the inkjet print hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>The process of experiencing this installation is not only physical, but also intellectual.  It reveals the importance of context and recalls art historical references.  The two pieces that make up this installation each have histories and are placed into a new context.  AIC notes that Mr. Guyton enlarged an existing digital file for his <em>Untitled</em> painting to match the width of the printer, and the previous exhibition site determined the canvas length.  The counter is a replica from the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh that departs from its original function and site.</p> 
 
<p>Of the two pieces, a coat-checker counter in a museum’s gallery appears out of place, implicitly raising the overarching question pertaining to context: why is such a counter inside a gallery?  This piece points to a change in the use-value and human interaction with an object dependent on context.  A similar counter in the lobby of a restaurant, theater or museum would serve different purposes: checking coats in and out, storing bags and even allowing people to lean against it.  But a potentially functional counter placed into the gallery space is now a work of art.  Despite its gallery location, <em>Untitled</em> asks for human interaction that is subsequently denied.  It stands at human height, and is tall enough to be leaned against; the front corners are rounded, a soft gesture indicating human contact; and the backside of the counter has open sections to store purses or book bags.  In another setting, these actions would be permissible&mdash;but not here.  Visitors who get too close set off a piercing alarm: a warning to step back from the art.</p> 
 
<p>Spending time with Mr. Guyton’s installation also reveals its many art historical layers.  His counter suggests an overt reference to Minimalism, an art movement that began in the early 1960s, which favored geometric forms and industrial materials.  Robert Morris, for instance, made visitors spatially aware of their environment by creating a situation for visitors to experience.  Thus, Mr. Guyton’s installation can also be seen as a situation created for visitors: the process of discovery unravels over time, and meaning is dependent on visitor engagement.</p>
 
<p>In regards to his inkjet images, Mr. Guyton acknowledges that he makes paintings, but does not consider himself a painter.  After seeing AIC’s installation, his statement carries a lot of weight: Mr. Guyton also creates experiences.</p>
