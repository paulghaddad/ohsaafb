<p>A computer or car phone may have been seen as luxuries or conveniences decades ago.  But their modern-day versions are deemed as lifelines today.  Can you imagine life without a cell phone?  Or perhaps more relevant, a smartphone?  People find it challenging to turn off their smartphones at dinner or at bedtime, let alone forgoing one all together.  The ubiquity and dependence on technology today is incontrovertible&mdash;in life and art.  Increasingly artists are turning to a sector that has infiltrated twenty-first century society: digital technology.</p>

<p>Today’s rise of technology is impacting the arts, and the distinction between art and non-art is becoming more challenging to determine.  Yet, this fusion is not unprecedented.  Jack Burnham’s <em>Software</em> exhibition in 1970 foresaw the influx of “information-processing systems,” and consequently, the blending of art and life.  Mr. Burnham’s exhibition catalogue essay noted that “information processing systems and their devices” were the “fastest growing” areas in culture at the time.  This aptly titled exhibition, <em>Software</em>, “point[ed] to the information technologies as a pervasive environment badly in need of the sensitivity traditionally associated with art.”  Indeed, what Mr. Burnham recognized over 40 years ago is being realized today.</p>

<p>The current exhibition at the Barbican Centre in London, <em>The Digital Revolution</em>, acknowledges the profusion of digital technology from the 1970s through the twenty-first century.  The curation replicates our over-stimulated technological world, where many things compete for our attention: from incessantly checking email to keeping up with Twitter. Exhibition pieces follow the same approach by overwhelming our senses and tacitly asking for visitor participation: listening to music, designing a potential work of art, playing a video game or creating a digital work. What is more, the variety of exhibitors, artists, filmmakers, architects, musicians and game developers that make up the exhibition blur the boundaries between art and life.</p>

<p>The show does a good job of eliciting two major themes: the permutation of digital technology in art, and the transition from hardware to software.  Digital technology is present throughout the exhibition.  As the exhibition progresses, so does the technology: from rudimentary and bulky machines to ideas and sleek graphics.  It begins with now dated objects, including a Pac-Man arcade game and a Nintendo game system with the Super Mario Brother’s game, that are available for play.  It advances towards art created with code, as demonstrated by DevArt by Google with the Barbican Centre.</p>

<p>“DevArt is about reappraising what art is,” Steve Vranakis, the Google Creative Lab Executive Creative Director explained in the press release.  “We want to show that technology can be a canvas for creativity and that developers are also artists, using code to make art.”  DevArt demonstrates the possibilities when art and technology merge, suggesting that coding is a form of creative art.</p>

<p>Karsten Schmidt, one of three commissioned interactive artists at this exhibition, developed a digital art installation titled, <em>Co(de) Factory</em>.  This online tool examines authorship in art by allowing anyone to “become an artist.”  The viewer creates, modifies and designs 3D digital sculptures that could be fabricated into a physical object and displayed in the exhibition.  Fusing a tangible object (a 3D printer) with the intangible (custom-built software) reveals the exhibition’s second theme: the transition from hardware to software.  This analogy also parallels Silicon Valley&mdash;a quintessential technology center and emerging art market in the United States.</p>

<p>The hardware and software analogy is apropos for this region.  It points towards Yiren Lu’s assessment in a 2014 <em>The New York Times</em> article: “[t]ech is no longer primarily technology driven; it is idea driven.”  Silicon Valley is recognized for producing technological devices such as semiconductors, microprocessors, and personal computers.  It is just as well known for its software created by Twitter, Google and LinkedIn, which are all Silicon Valley-based companies.<p>

<p>But hardware and software are not just used today in isolation, but in tandem.  Jack Burnham noted that “machines can only handle the ideas given to them by human beings.”  This comment suggests that hardware is only as good as the software that runs on it.  The iPhone, for instance, is a popular device because of its software and applications, from Facebook to Google maps, among many others.  And as Mr. Schmidt’s piece suggests, art appears to follow a similar model.</p>

<p>A world without technology is hard to fathom.  <em>The Digital Revolution</em> reveals how far technology has come, and its impact on the world of art.  This technological survey uncovers the changes from the primitive days of the bulky Pac-Man game to Mr. Schmidt’s suave online interface.  The range of exhibitors also indicates that the digital revolution is not limited to a specific region; digital technology is an art form that is having a worldwide impact.  But this is just the beginning, according to the show’s curator, Conrad Bodman.  “There’s so much happening in this field, but we’re only 50 years into it.  People say we’re in a golden age of digital media, though we’re just at the beginning.”</p>
