<p>A carefully placed postcard mostly covers the faces of a posed couple.  Three
people make up another scene; their bodies and faces are merely outlines, filled
in with layers of images.  A woman’s face in a black and white portrait is
entirely covered by a postcard.  Each collage is distinct, but they are united
by their “masked” appearance.</p>

<p>The artist behind these images is John Stezaker, a British conceptual artist
that has used postcards, photographs and film stills in his work for decades.
Stezaker’s current exhibition at Richard Gray Gallery in Chicago reveals the
artist’s strength in juxtaposing images.  The subsequent new forms may look
quickly put together, however, they are carefully arranged.</p>

<p>Take “Pair XXV,” where a black and white portrait depicts a man and woman
impeccably dressed and posed.  The couple leans in the same direction, and
perfection radiates: not even a strand of hair is out of place.  Facing the
viewer, their faces are partially covered with a nature-themed postcard.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>This is where Stezaker’s attention to detail emerges.  A sliver of the
woman’s mouth and portion of the man’s face, including a part of his right eye,
are left uncovered.  This decision creates an unsettling sensation: a beady eye
stares at the visitor.  Without the postcard, the man’s eyes would probably
convey happiness.  Indeed the voyeuristic visitor wants to peer into the minds
and lives of this young couple, but the postcard blocks a crucial means of
communication&mdash;the face.  Stezaker is known for configuring and reconfiguring
images, thus creating new artworks with new meanings, as he does here.  That
said, the visitor is forced to look for other visual cues to identify the sitter
and their thoughts.</p>

<p>Stezaker’s work is best understood by realizing how his collages differ from
other artists that have used the same medium.  Hannah Höch, a 20th century
artist, is credited as a leader in collage and photomontage.  Consider the words
and fragmented images in her collage, “Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through
the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany.”  Höch critiques political
culture of the day and comments on gendered roles in this college and others.
Stezaker has a different intent: instead of informing and drawing attention to
social issues, “collage is about interrupting the seam and making something
illegible,” he said in a 2014 article in <em>The Guardian</em>.  The artist repeatedly
puts these words to practice.</p>

<p>Images come with their own convictions.  Juxtaposing one or multiple parts
and pieces of various images, all equally laden with meaning, results in complex
and sometimes surreal collages.  In Stezaker’s “Marriage” series, for example,
he splits and slices portrait images of popular movie stars, creating a “hybrid”
image.  In this way, the artist gives and denies information to the viewer.</p>

<p>Most of the current works on show conceals, wholly or partially, the person or
people making up each collage, thereby redirecting the visitor’s gaze.  This
process differs from Stezaker’s past work.  A collage like “Marriage L”
vertically brings together an image showing half of a man’s face and half of a
female’s into one, “new” face.  This morphed figure makes eye contact with the
visitor, bringing them into their transformed world.  “Marriage XXVIII” follows
a similar motif: two images of opposite genders are also placed together
vertically.  The woman’s gaze is directed at the viewer.  Her piercing eye
paired with the man’s clenched fist holding a cigarette creates a formidable
scene.  But in Stezaker’s recent constructions, the sitter’s facial expressions
are oftentimes covered, indiscernible or absent.  Take “Pair XXVI.”   The faces
of the man and woman are covered, or masked, with the exception of the woman’s
lips.</p>

<p>Above all, Stezaker’s current collages evoke curiosity.  Consider a portrait
without the juxtaposition of another image or postcard: what meaning would the
single image have; how is the meaning altered with the addition of an image or
multiple images; which image should the viewer focus on?  “The Truth of Masks”
implicitly raises more questions than it provides answers.  But that appears to
be the point.  A show about masks should not reveal everything.  And it doesn’t,
which is what makes Stezaker’s exhibition engaging and worth seeing.</p>

<cite>“The Truth of Masks” is on show at Richard Gray Gallery until December 12,
