<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes once stated: “Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than the one where they sprang up.”  This quote was at the heart of the exhibition at Denmark’s Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, <em>Jorn &amp; Pollock A Meeting of Giants</em> (15 November 2013 &ndash; 23 February 2014), which brought together the legendary American artist, Jackson Pollock, and Denmark’s renowned Asger Jorn.  The show featured a juxtaposition of Pollock’s and Jorn’s artwork from 1943 to 1963; it tacitly asked the viewer to examine closely and assess critically the similarities and differences of these two post-war artists.  The success of this exhibition lay in placing familiar artists in an unfamiliar context: generating a conversation between two artists with a strikingly similar painting style, despite having never met and being separated by an ocean.  Thus, the power of collaboration immediately resonated after viewing the recent exhibition, <em>Control</em> (23 January to 30 March 2014), at Raven Row in London, England. </p>

<p><em>Control</em> is the first survey of the English conceptual artist and sculptor, Stephen Willats, from the 1960s.  This solo show focused on the years between 1962 to 1969, a period indicative of his multidisciplinary work&mdash;as a designer, artist, social scientist and engineer&mdash;and his keen interest in communication and social interaction.  This comprehensive survey included interactive sculptures from Mr. Willats's ‘Manual Variables’ series; a display of constructions from his 1968 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art Oxford that explored issues of behavioral science, color, probability, among other contemporary theories; and issues of <em>Control</em> magazine, a publication he began during this period that still runs today.  His magazine and the title of the exhibition share the same name, and refer to a quintessential theme that runs throughout both: cybernetics.  Mr. Willats emphasized the ways in which an individual could move from a passive to an active role in an environment by exerting control within a complex system.  Indeed, this notion of cybernetics is also an unspoken parallel between Mr. Willats and several American artists that concurrently explored the same concept in art.</p>

<p><em>Control</em> encouraged viewers to participate in the systems Mr. Willats created, physically and intellectually.  For example, his <em>Environmental Box</em> (1962/2014), a reconstruction of the original, encourages visitors to respond to a posed statement.  The 2014 version included a waist-high station made of plywood that included pens, built-in boxes and a clip-board holding sheets of paper with the following directions: “Select a colour from the variable sheets provided, open one of the boxes and putting your hand inside feel the contents, then make a drawing below of the image that comes into your mind.”  The instructions, which are subjective and open to interpretation, create a system that actively engages the viewer to ultimately complete the artwork.  The parallel wall displayed the visitor results, which were all different.</p>

<blockquote>'Willats’ overarching plan was to reinvent the function of the individual in society,' Antony Hudek explains, 'by transforming her or him from passive consumer of messages into a highly aware and responsive element of larger complex systems&mdash;the social fabric&mdash;upon which she or he could exert control.'</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Importantly, Mr. Willats’s interests in using systems in art and the emphasis on the active viewer in the late 1960s resembled artistic practices in the United States.  Although <em>Control</em> was a solo exhibition, the overarching cybernetic theme recalls the famous 1970 <em>Software</em> exhibition in the US, where artists explored some of the same questions, theories and ideas halfway across the world.</p>

<p>Jack Burnham organized the <em>Software</em> exhibition in 1970 at the Jewish Museum (USA), which also embraced the cybernetic notion of systems and processes in art.  Mr. Burnham argues:</p>

<blockquote>[<em>Software</em>] demonstrates the effects of contemporary control and communication techniques in the hands of artists.  Most importantly it provides the means by which the public can personally respond to programmatic situations structured by artists.</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Cybernetics coincided with the American post-war culture, which shifted from a manufacturing economy towards a service-based one using processes and systems.  Consequently, art moved away from the physical art object towards a transactional art emphasizing communication and exchange.  This transformation resulted in an art based on systems, processes, linguistics and environmental relations.  <em>Software</em> incorporated artists such as Hans Haacke, Vito Acconci, Lawrence Weiner and many others that employed this cybernetic concept.  Thus, given the intention of this exhibition, there are striking parallels between art produced in America during this time and Stephen Willats’s work in England.  Examining the benefits of collaboration in the Louisiana Museum’s exhibition, <em>Jorn &amp; Pollock A Meeting of Giants</em>, underscores how Stephen Willats’s exhibition could have used a similar construct.</p>

<p>The power of the Louisiana Museum’s exhibition, <em>Jorn &amp; Pollock A Meeting of Giants</em>, lay in the collaborative curatorial style.  Far from a competition, placing Jackson Pollock’s and Asger Jorn’s works in conversation engaged the viewer in an active role: making comparisons and drawing connections between two artists with much in common, despite living and working on different continents.  This juxtaposition of these works inevitably raised the question: who inspired who?  Leaving it open for interpretation, the exhibition engaged the viewer to carefully examine how two artists approached art with such different aims, yet resulted in such a similar style.  Although both were influenced by surrealism, fascinated by myths and worked in drip and automatic drawing, their aims were very different.  A Marxist and member of the Danish Communist party, Jorg saw art as political.  Pollock saw art as a separate world independent from social and political engagement.  Indeed the success of this exhibition resulted an environment created for the viewer: a subjective experience that actively engaged the viewer in an intellectual conversation, and an opportunity to see familiar artists in a new context.</p>

<p><em>Jorn &amp; Pollock A Meeting of Giants</em> exemplifies the power of collaboration.  It created an enjoyable experience by actively engaging the viewer to determine common themes, examine differences and think about the social and cultural impact of two important artists.  Although not always feasible to create a retrospective such as <em>Jorn &amp; Pollock A Meeting of Giants</em>, simply acknowledging other artists that embraced the same concept from around the world during a similar time period is beneficial.  It expands the viewer’s understanding of an artist and their artwork, and places the work in context.  Thus, the benefits of collaboration cannot go unstated, as Michael Michalko explains, “Collaboration over time creates a different understanding of a subject.” While <em>Control</em> was undoubtedly a comprehensive solo exhibition, it could have been strengthened through collaboration.  Since cybernetics has been largely influential on art in America, it would have been relevant to place Mr. Willats’s work in conversation these artists.  Actively engaging the viewer in an exchange of information between artworks and artists working in the same genre from different parts of the world tacitly asks one to think critically, look closely and examine carefully&mdash;a process that ultimately results in seeing an artist, artwork or concept in a new context.</p>
