artdiversions
=============

## Purpose

This site is a blog about contemporary art for my wife, ArtDiversions. Please visit the site at:

http://www.artdiversions.com/

## How it was built

Jekyll, a static-site generator built in Ruby, was used to create the functionality of the blog. The HTML, CSS and Javascript were written starting from my personal framework: 

https://github.com/paulh16/pgh_framework

Other tools used to build the site are:

* Bower
* Respond.js for media queries in Internet Explorer 8
* SASS
* Grunt
* Modernizr
* Adobe Typekit Fonts

The site is responsive, starting from a mobile layout. The layout adjusts several times as the screen widens until it reaches the desktop version. The site is deployed on Github Pages with a custom domain name.
