Rule 6-1-9b indicates that R has the following options when K kicks a free kick
OOB untouched by R:

a. Accept 5 yd pen and K rekicks

b. Accept 5 yd pen from succeeding spot

c. Put the ball in play 25 yds beyond the previous spot

d. Decline the penalty and put the ball in play at the inbounds spot.

**Question 1:** in C, since 25 yards beyond the previous spot is the succeeding
spot, would R also get an additional 5 yds? The way the rule book reads, and the
casebook presents examples, this is not the way it is done. 

**Answer:** The 35 is not the
succeeding spot. The succeeding spot by definition (pg 38 NFHS Rules) is “the
spot where the ball would next be snapped or free kicked is a foul had not
occurred.” The 35 is an enforcement option, not a succeeding spot.

**Question 2:** If that is accurate, taking it one step further, if the free kick
by K goes OOB at the R 36 yd line, then R would take the ball at that spot plus
they would get a 5 yd penalty tacked on. First and 10 from the R 41. However, if
the free kick goes OOB at the R 31 yd line, the R would be better to choose the
option to take the ball at the R 31 and then tack on an additional 5 yds. First
and 10 from the R 36.

**Answer:** You are correct on these.

**Question 3:** Why would R ever choose D? By doing so, they are foregoing an
additional 5 yds.

**Answer:** They never would, but D’s spot is the succeeding spot.
