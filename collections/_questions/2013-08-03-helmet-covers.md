I saw an article this morning in the USA Today on a "new" helmet cover that is
supposed to lesson concussions. This is the first time that I have seen or heard
about these. Are these legal? Are they legal with a letter from the state? There
is a picture of a high school player from CO and the article goes into depth on
how this is going to be used by South Carolina University. [Click here to view
the article](http://www.usatodayhss.com/news/article/guarding-head-is-big-business-concussions-helmet).

*Per NFHS these helmet attachments are legal.*
