title:  "Motion Man doing a Back-Flip"

Play 1: The offense would send one man in motion.  This motion man would do a
“back-flip” while in motion to draw the attention of the defense (head coaches
own words).  The offense would then snap the ball and run the play in the
opposite direction.


Play 2: Same as Play 1 – except this time the motion man instead of doing a back-flip,
while in motion would turn and yell toward the QB, “throw me the ball, throw me
the ball” prior to the snap.  The offense would snap the ball and run the play
in the opposite direction.
