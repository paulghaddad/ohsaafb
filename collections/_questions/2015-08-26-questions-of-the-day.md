A coach has used his 3 time outs for the half. He then wants a Coach Official
Conference for a misapplicaiton of a rule. He is wrong, since we cannot charge
him with a time out, is it a 5 yard delay of game foul or a 15 yard
unsporstmanlike foul?

*5-yard Delay of game (3-6-2c)*

Can the Head Coach accompany his captains to the center of the field for the
coin toss? Or does he have to stay at the Hash Marks?

*No, Hash Marks.*

On a kickoff the kicking team only has 3 players on one side of the kicker. The
ball is then kicked. Who throws the flag and whistles the play dead?

*The Umpire/Back Judge or the Referee. U/BJ. Gold Book page 15, 21-C-7.*
