Page 35 of the Gold Book, item 6, addresses drones. During weeks 1-10 it
indicates that drone policy is left up to the school.

A question arose during our Sunday chapter meeting regarding drones. A local
school has already indicated that they plan to use a drone to film games, or at
least part of a game.


Our question centers around how to handle the inevitable objection by the
visiting team when it becomes known to their head coach that the home team is
flying a drone overhead during the game. 


What is our responsibility regarding the drone? I know it is school policy as
indicated in the GB. But what if the drone becomes a distraction by being too
close? What if the visiting team head coach raises hell because his opponent is
using a drone to "spy" on his team (so he says anyway)? When does the drone
become a problem for the officials that, in your opinion, would require us to
order the drone be shutdown?

*The home team can use a drone if its own school policy allows it to do so. The
visiting team cannot stop the home team from using one. But if at any time the
officials feel that the drone is too close and/or a distraction, then the
officials can pause the game and force the home team to stop using it (or fly it
higher, out of the way, etc.). But it would need to be the officials who feel itâ€™s a distraction, not the
visiting team.*
