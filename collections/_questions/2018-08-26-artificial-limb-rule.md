Question 1: A question came up last night at are rules meeting about pants covering the
knee.  This happened at a scrimmage last week-end.  The same two or three
players have pants that were not covering the knee were sent off for one play.
Once they returned, after a few plays, the pants have ridden back past the knee,
play sent off.  This happened quite a few times during the scrimmage, with the
player or players being sent off for one play. The question is, how many times
do you send off the player before invoking rule 9-5-1-g, player refusing to
comply with a game official's request or unsportsmanlike rule 9-8-1-h against
the coach?

Question 2: A artificial limb may be worn with OHSAA approval.  We have some
schools that play non OHSAA schools, out of state or from Canada.  If a player
has a artificial limb from one of those schools, do they still have to have
OHSAA approval?  Do they play if they do not?

*For Question 1: Keep sending them off. The coach will get it corrected if he
wants them to play. That was our experience last year. For Question 2: This is
fine. They do not need permission.*
