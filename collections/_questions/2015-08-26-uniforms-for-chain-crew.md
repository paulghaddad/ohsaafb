I understand that stripped shirts are now prohibited for Chain Crews, but what
should we do in the case of schools/conferences assigning officials to the Chain
Crew? Typically, they arrive and wear their officiating uniform.

*They will need to wear something over their stripe shirts -- or take off the
stripe shirt & wear something underneath it -- black shirt, white shirt, etc. We
talked with 8 - 10 LJ's who had to look across the field at 4 or 5 stripe shirts
-- it was both challenging & frustrating for them trying to locate the HL. That
is why we added the Policy.*
