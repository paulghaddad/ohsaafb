I know on page 36 of the gold book that it states drones are allowed weeks 1-10
if school allows. My question is are they allowed to fly over the playing field?
If they are not allowed where do I find the information not allowing them?

<!--more-->

*It is up to the school and the FAA where they fly, HOWEVER the referee can always require them to come down if they interfere with the game.*
