1. Players wearing arm sleeves that are not connected to the uniform or an under
   shirt, mainly worn to cover the biceps, elbow and forearm, They are also not
considered a pad nor a wrist band. I consider them a uniform adornment and not
legal, am I miss applying this rule? It seems every week coaches here a
different ruling as well.

*Legal as long as not ball colored.*

2. If tackle #70 lines up on the end of the line and at the snap goes back
   behind the quarterback and catches a backward pass is this allowed?

*I have found rule 7-4-2 page 59 that would indicate it would be legal.*
