This question concerns sending players off when they are close to getting an
UNS. We have done this for years and haven't had an issue. I am waiting for
someone to ask me if we take an official's TO for this. There are probably going
to be times when a defensive player needs to be sent off but the offensive is in
a hurry-up and the substitution can't be made without being put at a
disadvantage. Since we don't want to put the defense at a disadvantage and we
don't want to penalize them when we have identified the issue I would go ahead
and take an officials TO. Is this correct?

*Send the player when it is appropriate -- if A is in a hurry-up, then wait a few
plays to where B is not gaining an advantage by the Officials calling an
Officials Time-out. Player does not have to be sent immediately after the down
is over; officials can wait a few downs until it is appropriate & neither team
has gained an advantage.*
