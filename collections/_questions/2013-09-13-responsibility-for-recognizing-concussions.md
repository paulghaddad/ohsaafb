I don't know whether you're hearing this from other crew chiefs/officials but
it's frequently being said.

At all of our varsity games this year at least one coach or team trainer has
stated they don't want any of the officials making a determination of whether
one of their players has signs and/or symptoms of a concussion and should be
done for the day.

They've stated they would like for us to stop the game and not to conduct any
evaluation at all of the player and let their trained medical personnel handle
the situation due to the strict restrictions of the Ohio return to play law.

How should crews be handling this when coaches make this request/demand?

*I would indicate that you always want to stop the game for any player that is
injured and have them evaluated by professionals. Most officials do not want to
evaluate injured players. That being said, if you have an obvious concussion
symptom with a player, you will be sending them out for that and they will not
return.*
