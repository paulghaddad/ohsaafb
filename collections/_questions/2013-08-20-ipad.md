I understand where and who can use technology, such as an iPad, but to what
extent can an iPad be used? Are coaches allowed to take pictures or videos and
review them during a game or at halftime? What I would like to do is have my
coaches in the press box to take a picture of how our opponent lines up to our
formations. I would then like to have the coaches verbally relay to me their
alignment. Please advise me if this is legal.

*What you describe below is perfectly legal. The only restrictions are showing
any of this to a player inside the 9 yard marks.*
