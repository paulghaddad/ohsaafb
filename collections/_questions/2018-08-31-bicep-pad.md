We have a few players who wear shoulder pads that have additional pads that can
attach or detach from the actual shoulder pad. They are made to protect the
upper arms, and obviously cannot be covered by all jerseys. The pads are covered
in a cloth material and are not made of hard plastic. I brought this to the
attention of the referees before this past Fridays game and they said they
believed the pads are legal and ok to wear.

*By NFHS Rules, if they are attached to the shoulder pad, then they must be
covered by the jersey. If they are detached, they are like any other pad and if
they are hard and unyielding, they must be padded. These do not look hard, so if
detached, they donâ€™t need to be covered.*
