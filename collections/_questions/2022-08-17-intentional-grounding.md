During the state rules interpreter meeting on 7/22 you covered the new IG rule exceptions. During that discussion you stated that if the passer was being contacted at the time he throws the pass then IG should not be called. During our chapter meeting today (Sunday) a question was asked about the definition of “contact”. Specifically the official asked if “pulling or tugging the jersey” constitutes “contact”. Can you clarify this for me?
