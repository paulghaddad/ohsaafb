We had a good question about game balls in our virtual meeting Tuesday.  A crew told the team that the game balls had to be new or nearly new to be legal in Week 3.  The did allow the balls to be used for the game.  The team used the same balls in Week 2 without question.  The term “New – Nearly New” is not part of the Gold Book or Rule Book currently, but was used in the past.  The reference to Game Footballs in the Gold Book is on Page 38 #10.
