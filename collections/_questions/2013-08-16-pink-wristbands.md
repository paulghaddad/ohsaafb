We have a school locally that did pink wristbands for breast cancer awareness.
The only problem was they were so big they had to be worn by both teams on the
upper arm basically on the bicep where by rule these are illegal. Can they wear
these if we see it this year?

*Yes they have to meet NFHS rules.*
