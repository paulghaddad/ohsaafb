My crew was doing a football scrimmage, and all went well until after the scrimmage a siren located on
the top of the school sounded. When we asked the AD what that was for he said
it's a lightning detector. It detects when there is lightning within 10-15 miles
of the school.  There were some dark clouds but we did not see any lighting or
hear any thunder.  He also stated that its the school's policy that if it sounds
off to have all the students and staff clear the fields and head indoors.  So my
question is, what is OHSAA's policy on this?

Follow the school's policy and determine if it is safe to continue.
