Is a straight arm a targeting foul if directed to the opponent's helmet or
facemask?

*A straight arm by a player is legal and not a foul for targeting, even though
the straight arm is to the player's helmet, face mask, etc. However, if the
straight arm is a overt type of "blow" to the opponent, then it would obviously
be a personal foul.*
