For the interpretation of a defenseless player, Rule 2-32-16A says that you
cannot hit a quarterback while in his throwing motion. Is this a defenseless
player foul?

*The roughing the passer rules have not changed. The rules makers broadened the
definition on defenseless players that basically eliminated the fact that
hitting a defenseless player is a foul. Rule 2-32-16 says " A player who
initiates contact against a defenseless player is responsible for making legal
contact." Thus a player can contact a defenseless player legally.*
