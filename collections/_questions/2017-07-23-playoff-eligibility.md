What qualifies to be eligible for playoffs? I have heard 8 varsity games for 2
straight seasons, being eligible in the 2nd season. I have also heard 8 varsity
games AT THE SAME POSITION for 2 straight seasons, being eligible in the 2nd
season.

*Check the Gold Book, P. 47, 2 B. Must officiate a minimum of 8 Varsity Games two
years in a row. During the current season must officiate 8 Varsity Games at the
same Position you are applying for the State Playoffs.â€‹ Note: 6 Man & 7 Man
Crews do not count toward the 8 games.*
