1. Just prior to the snap the BJ flagged B for illegal substitution. At the same
   time the U flagged A1 for a ssnap infraction. Both flags were throw at the
same exact time. These are both dead ball 5 yard fouls. The R signaled illegal
substitution on B and snap infraction on A. He then announced the fouls offset.

Assuming these did actually occur at the same exact time (????). These fouls
should not have offset according to NFHS rule 10-2-5a. They should've been
enforced in the order of which they occurred.

As an R, I ALWAYS try to ensure which team fouled first. In this scenario, if
the DB foul on B went first then the DB foul on A didn't happen or vice versa.

If this did occur then this should not be covered under the rule change of
offsetting dead ball fouls which was a rule change in 2014 or 2015 that states
equal UNS, non-player or DB personal fouls will offset.

*The only person who would know "when they occurred" is the BJ since he knows
when the B Illegal Substitution occurred. And if a defensive lineman is blocking
the view of the Center, then probably nobody knows when each fouled occurred.*

2. I heard that when you escort a player to the coach and advise him that that
   the player is "Approaching Fouling Status," that player must sit out at least
one play. Situation: on a PAT, B66 is involved in some words/hand-fighting at
the end of the play. HL informs HC of B66's actions. After the KO, B66 comes in
on offense (B66 was not normally on the KO team) - does this constitute having
sat out a play?

*Check the 4th sentence in the GB, P. 14, # 17A. HC can send him back in the game
when he thinks "he is ready to play FB". There is no set number of plays.*
