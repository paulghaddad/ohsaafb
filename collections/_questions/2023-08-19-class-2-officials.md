Just saw the Pre-season Bulletin and had a question about the use of Class 2
officials for playoffs. Does this mean Class 2 officials will be used when all
eligible Class 1 officials have been assigned? Or does this mean that eligible
Class 1 officials can be passed over for playoff assignments by lesser qualified
Class 2 officials?

I only ask because it does not seem fair to use less qualified Class 2 officials
when there are qualified Class 1 officials who do not get a chance for playoff
assignments.
