What is the penalty for the visiting team wearing a colored jersey?

*Review Case Book play 1-5-1 Situation C. The Referee may ask the visiting team
to change to white jerseys, ask the home team to change to white jerseys or play
the game if the jerseys contrast. In all instances, report this incident to the
proper authorities (Beau Rugg). There is no game penalty (unsportsmanlike
conduct) prescribed.*
