Team K is in a scrimmage kick formation for a TRY by kick. The holder K1 has his
knee on the ground and is controlling the ball on the tee. The kicker K2 comes
up and takes the ball off the tee from K1â€™s grasp. Is the ball dead or does it
remain live?

*It doesn't. The fact is that the kicker "taking" it from the holder is the same
as the holder handing it. Dead ball.*
