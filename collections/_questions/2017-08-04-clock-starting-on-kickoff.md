Case book play 3.4.2B. The answer makes you believe that on a kickoff under 2
minutes and the offended team chooses to have clock started on snap, that the
clock would not start at any time during the kick. So you kick off and you have
a run back with no time off clock. Is this correct?

*The clock would start when the kick is touched in the field of play by R.*
