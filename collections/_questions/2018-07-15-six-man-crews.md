title:  "6 Man Crews During the Regular Season"

I am asking for clarification on using 6 man officiating crews during the
regular season games in 2018. Since the Gold Book does not contain any mechanics
for 6 man crews, will the regular season crews be limited to 5, and as was
stated last year, a 6 man crew will not count toward the games needed for
playoff consideration? Some crews have anticipated going toward 6 man crews,
splitting monies, etc. Some assigners have posted 6 man crews.
If 6 man is only to be used in playoffs, officials and assigners need to be told
this ASAP to allow for scheduling adjustments.

*6-person crews are permissible if approved by me.*
