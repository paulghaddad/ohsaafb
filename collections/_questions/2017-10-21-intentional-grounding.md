We had a situation in our game Friday night where the quarterback received a
snap in the shotgun formation and intentional spiked the ball. It was not called
a penalty and I thought the QB had to be under center to do that. In fact, I
thought it was a point of emphasis that you brought up in the video. When I
questioned it, the line judge said this is not the NFL and that I was wrong. Am
I correct on this ruling or am I wrong?

*You are absolutely correct.*
