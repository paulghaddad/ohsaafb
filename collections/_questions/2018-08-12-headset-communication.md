Yesterday I worked a scrimmage and the head coach for appeared to be calling in his plays to the QB from his headset to a
speaker in the QBâ€™s helmet, as is common at higher levels of football.  Is would
appear that this violates Rule 1-5-3c(2).  Is that correct, or is this method of
communication allowed at the HS level?
