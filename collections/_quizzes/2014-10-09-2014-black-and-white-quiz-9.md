answers](https://storage.googleapis.com/ohsaa-websites/quizzes/2014/2014_black_and_white_quiz_9.pdf).

## Rules
1. K, 4/7 at R’s 24 YL. K’s FG try is unsuccessful and the crew spots the ball
   at R’s 24 YL, 1/10.

2. After the LM marks FP on a play that results in a first down for the VT, a
   member of the chain crew makes a derogatory comment about the LM’s forward
progress spot. The LM then throws a flag for UNS conduct on the HT for the chain
member’s comment.

3. FK from K’s 40 YL. While the FK is in flight, R35 blocks below the waist at
   R’s 42 YL. The ball rolls to R’s 7 YL where R1 muffs the ball and it breaks
the plane of R’s GL.

4. A, 3/7 on B’s 20 YL. A12’s forward pass is intended for A86 near B’s GL. B22
   leaps into the air at B’s2 YL and grasps the football. His momentum carries
him through the air and he returns to the ground in the EZ where he takes a
knee.

5. A10 throws a screen pass to A26 behind the LOS. A66 and A78 have gone
   downfield on the play. The ball goes off the hands of A26 and crosses the LOS
where it is caught by A88 for a first down.

6. A, 3/7 on A’s 40 YL. A17 hands off to A28 who is hit behind the LOS and
   fumbles the ball at A’s 36 YL. As the ball is rolling toward the SL, A17
attempts to recover the ball, but muffs it OOB at A’s 30 YL. After the ball goes
OOB, A28 shoves B34 and is flagged for a PF at A’s 36 YL. Where is the penalty
enforced: from the spot of the fumble, the spot of the foul or the OOB spot?

7. A, 4/10 at B’s 20 YL. A8 goes 1 yard beyond the LOS and throws a pass that is
   intercepted by B11 at B’s 2 YL where he is down. What are B’s options?

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. A runs a play in which they send a man in motion and when he is in front of
   the QB, the QB throws a short “shovel” pass. The distance of the pass is
minimal and if not completed can look like a fumble. What mechanics should the R
use to be able to correctly rule on such a
play?

9. Can the coin toss be held prior to 20 minutes before the start of the game?

## OHSAA Regulations
10. Late in a game, the crew of officials hears a rumble of thunder and stops
    the game. Game management approaches the crew and tells them that their
meters do not detect any lightning in the area and wants the crew to complete
the game.
