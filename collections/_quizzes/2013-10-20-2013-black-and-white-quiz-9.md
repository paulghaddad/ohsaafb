## OHSAA Rules
1. A, 2/10 from A’s 35 YL. Late in the second quarter. A7 is in a shotgun
   formation at A’s 27 YL. A26, who is a running back is lined up behind the
left tackle and turned sideways toward the center. A7, in order to stop the
clock, throws the ball at the feet of A26 who has turned toward A7.

2. K, 4/8 on K’s 10 YL. Kicker, K13’s punt is blocked, never crosses the NZ, and
   winds up back in K’s EZ where opposing players simultaneously recover it.
Safety or TD?

3. K, 4/10 on K’s 45 YL. K1 kicks the ball beyond the NZ. R11 muffs the ball
   back behind the NZ where K1 recovers and: (a) falls on the ball at K’s 40 YL;
or (b) throws a FP to K88 which is complete at the 50 YL and R17 interfered with
K88; or (c) K1 punts the ball and R1 FC at his 30 YL, or (d) runs to R’s 40 YL.

4. K, 4/10 at K’s 40 YL. K13 kicks the ball almost straight up. The ball is
   caught by K27 behind the LOS. All players “freeze”, not knowing what to do.
K27 then throws the ball forward and OOB.

5. K, 4/5 at the 50 YL. K’s kick is touched by K44 at R’s 5 YL. R17 muffs the
   ball at R’s 6 YL and the ball is recovered by K55 at R’s 10 YL. During the
kick, R81 holds at R’s 15 YL. Clock status?

6. A, 1/G at B’s 9 YL. A12’s pass is intercepted by B36 at B’s 3 YL. His
   momentum carries him into the EZ where he is hit and fumbles the ball into
the field of play. In (a) the fumble is grounded and A77 muffs the ball at the B
2 YL. The ball hits the pylon; or (b), the fumble has not been grounded (still
in flight), and A 77 muffs the ball at the B 2 YL. The ball hits the pylon.

7. A, 1/10 on A’s 10 YL. QB A10 drops back into A’s EZ where he is tackled by
   B67 who twists A10’s face mask. The tackle by B67 causes A10 to fumble the
ball which rolls forward and OOB at A’s 5 YL.

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. A, 1/10 at A’s 11 YL. A12 drops back into the EZ where he is tackled by the
   face mask and fumbles the ball. What are the R’s mechanics to cover this
play?

9. How should the Wings communicate to each other before plays where it is close
   to a first down?

## OHSAA Regulations
10. Both teams use the same exit from the field. How should the officials handle
    the teams at the end of the first half?
