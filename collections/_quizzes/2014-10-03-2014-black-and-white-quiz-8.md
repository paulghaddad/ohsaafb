answers](https://storage.googleapis.com/ohsaa-websites/quizzes/2014/2014_black_and_white_quiz_8.pdf).

## Rules
1. A sets up for a two point Try in a “swinging gate” formation; the snapper is
   on the end of the LOS wearing number #22. There are six A players to the left
of the snapper with five wearing 50 -79 numbers. A wide receiver is to the right
of the snapper, but off the LOS. A22 snaps the ball to QB A10, and then goes
into the EZ where A10 throws a pass to him for two points. Legal or illegal?

2. On a FK, RT has only has four players on their FK line (between their 45 and
   50 YL). The U penalizes R for not having 5 R players on their FK line.

3. A, 2/5 at A’s 25 YL. A7’s pass is intercepted by B16 and returned to A’s 10
   YL, where B16 fumbles. A26 recovers the ball inbounds at A’s 8 YL. Clock?

4. A, 4/5 on R’s 30 YL. During a successful FG, R13 grasps and twists K2’s FM at
   R’s 20 YL.

5. B36 intercepts A’s pass on B’s 4 YL with his momentum taking him into his EZ.
   While in the EZ, B36 fumbles the ball and (a) the ball rolls through the EZ,
(b) the loose ball rolls back into the field of play and goes OOB at B’s 6 YL,
or (c) the loose ball rolls back into the field of play and then is muffed back
into the EZ where B23 falls on the ball.

6. Fourth quarter. A, 4/10 at A’s 47 YL. A is behind 14–7. A12 throws a legal FP
   to eligible A88 who makes an obscene gesture to B17 before he crosses the GL
for a TD. Time expires during the down. The R rules that A loses 14-13 because
you can’t extend the period for an UNS foul.

7. A89’s pants/knee pads cover his knees at the beginning of the play; however
   during the play his pants/knee pads ride up over his knees. This happens
repeatedly during the game. Can the player continue to participate as long as he
is compliant at the beginning of the play?

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. On KOs the BJ and U are to jog to the near HM on the 50 YL and stop-n-watch.

9. On multiple dead ball fouls, how should the R handle the enforcement?

## OHSAA Regulations
10. A new high school field, funded by a professional soccer team, has been
    installed with permanent yellow soccer lines. For football games white lines
are temporarily painted on the field. Is the field legally marked?
