# NFHS Rules & OHSAA Policies/Preseason Bulletins

1. Orange bean bags are required for 2021.

2. The 40 second PC is required for all situations in a varsity game.

3. If teams are substituting the U should stand in front of the snapper until
   both teams have a chance to substitute.

4. After a long run the R should wait for the chain crew to be in place before
   giving the RFP.

5. If the LJ is unsure the LTG has been met he/she will stop the GC to allow the
   R to take a look. Afterwards, the R will
reset the PC to 40 sec.

6. If the field has a visible PC the BJ does not have to count down with his
   hand in the air.

7. The orange BB should be used to spot the ball on each down.

# OHSAA Mechanics

   ball.

   stop the GC (2X) before signaling the new direction (2X). 

# OHSAA Regulations

10. There is a safety in a jr. high game. The crew places the ball at the A’s 45
    YL (25 yards away from the normal FK line following a safety) for the next
set of downs.
