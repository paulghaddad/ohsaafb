## Rules
1. A, 3/18, at A’s 22 YL. QB A8 throws a deep pass down the right SL. B17 seeing
   that he is going to be beat deep, intentionally tackles A88 at A’s 35 YL to
prevent a TD.

2. A, 2/8, at B’s 15 YL. A84 runs directly at defensive back B13 and pushes off
   for a pass that goes for a TD. Time expires during the play. Foul? Extension
of period? Clock?

3. A, 1/10 on B’s 35 YL. QB A10 rolls to his right and throws a pass from B’s 33
   YL that is caught for a TD. Time expires during the play.

4. A, 4/13 at B’s 20 YL. A12 runs to the B’s 16 YL, is hit and fumbles. While
   the ball is rolling at B’s 10 YL, A76 holds B55 at B’s 12 YL to prevent him
from getting to the ball. The ball rolls OOB at B’s 4 YL.

5. A, 2/9 on A’s 40 YL. A1 fumbles at his 35 YL. While the ball is loose a PF is
   called on A5 at A’s 38 YL. A2 recovers the fumble at his 33 YL and advances
to his 41 YL. The penalty is accepted.

6. A, 3/10 at A’s 20 YL. A1 runs a pass pattern and intentionally runs OOB at
   A’s 40 YL. He does not return inbounds until A2 has caught a legal forward
pass at A’s 35 YL. A1 then returns inbounds at midfield and blocks B3 at B’s 47
YL. A2 is downed at A’s 45 YL.

7. It’s an awareness game and the team is wearing pink wrist bands; however, the
   bands are so big that the players are wearing them up on their biceps.

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. A, 3/8 at A’s 48 YL. The QB is in a shotgun formation. He is standing on A’s
   40 YL. What is the IP for the R in this case?

9. A, 4/8 on A’s 43 YL. The punter is on A’s 30 YL. What is the IP for the R?

## OHSAA Regulations
10. During a 9th grade game the officials notice that some interior linemen are
    wearing eligible receiver numbers. Legal or illegal?
