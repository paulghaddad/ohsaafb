## Free Kicks and Fair Catch
1. K’s KO team is in a “starburst” formation (all players are in a huddle with
   the kicker in the center and between the 35 to 40 YL). After the RFP they
sprint to their positions with at least 4 players on each side of the kicker.

2. After the RFP and prior to the ball being kicked, K has 6 players to the
   right of the kicker and 4 players to the left of the kicker. As K1 approaches
the ball, K2 and K3, from the right side of the ball, “loop” around the ball so
they are on the left side of the kicker when K1 tries an onside kick to the left
side of their formation. K2 and K3 stay within the 35 to 40 YL.

3. After the RFP and prior to the ball being kicked, K has 6 players to the
   right of the kicker and 4 players to the left of the kicker. In (a), the
kicker, K1, is a left footed soccer kicker which places him to the right side of
the ball and places K2 between him and the ball or (b), K1 is a right footed
soccer kicker which places him to the left side of the ball and places K3
between him and the ball.

4. After the RFP and prior to the ball being kicked, K has 5 players to the
   right of the kicker and 5 players to the left of the kicker. K1 is lined up
at the K32 YL to begin his kick and all other K players are between the 35 to 40
YL. As K1 approaches the ball, he hesitates and K2 then kicks an onside kick.

5. R6 muffs a KO at the - 5 YL. In order to prevent K from recovering the ball
   R13 kicks the loose ball out of the back of the EZ.

6. K, 4/7 from K’s 34 YL. K1’s punt goes almost straight up. R1 signals for a FC
   at K’s 38YL. In (a), R1 catches the ball behind K’s LOS at K’s 31 YL and the
LJ blows his whistle. In (b), K2 catches the ball behind the LOS at K’s 31 YL
and the LJ blows his whistle.

7. K’s punt is beyond the NZ and R33 and R17 both signal for a FC. R33 muffs the
   ball and R17 is about to catch it when he is blocked by K15.

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. HT scores on the TD and Try to go up 30 - 0 with 24 seconds left on the GC in
   the 4th quarter. The R winds the GC when he marks the ball RFP prior to the
KO. The HT does not KO. Time expires on the GC.

9. HT is winning 49 – 0 at halftime. Both the HT and VT HC’s get together at
   halftime and agree to shorten the varsity game quarters; reducing them from
12 minutes to 8 minutes in the second half. Since the HC’s have reduced the
quarter length, they ask the crew not to apply the new OHSAA Point Differential
Rule.

## OHSAA Regulations
10. After a controversial ending to a game, the R is approached by a member of
    the media asking for a clarification on the play at the end of the game.
