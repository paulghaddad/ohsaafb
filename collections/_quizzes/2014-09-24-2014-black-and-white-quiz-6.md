In Quiz 3, question #1, the third ruling is incorrect. R is the offended team,
not the “offending” team. Also, the 25 yards beyond the FK line for a KOOB is
considered a spot penalty and not a yardage penalty. Therefore, R will put the
ball in play at R’s 20 YL.

## Rules
1. A, 1/10 at B’s 25 YL. B35 intercepts A10’s pass in B’s EZ. During the return,
   B18 holds in B’s EZ and A76 tackles B35 by the face mask at B’s 15 YL.

2. A, 4/7 and is in a scrimmage kick formation. B13 realizing he is not on the
   punt return team and is the 12th player is attempting to leave the field when
the ball is snapped. B13 is between his team’s HM and the SL when the ball is
snapped. The officiating crew penalizes R 15 yards for illegal participation.

3. A gains a 1st down, but a dead ball UNS penalty is called. The crew sets the
   chains and then marks off the 15 yard penalty, A, 1/25.

4. A, 3/12 on B’s 35 YL. A12 throws an incomplete legal forward pass to the
   right side of the field. B6 holds A86 10 yards down field on the left side of
the field. The LJ calls defensive holding on B6. The crew enforces a 5 yard
penalty with an automatic first down.

5. A, 4/12 at B’s 45 YL with 14 seconds remaining in the second quarter. A5
   drops back to pass, then decides to run. At B’s 30 YL he throws a forward
pass to A89 in B’s EZ. Time expires during the play.

6. B1 intercepts A10’s pass at B’s 15 YL. B1 returns the interception along A’s
   SL and is downed at A’s 40 YL. During B1’s return, the LM (a), runs into a
cameraman between the restraining line and SL, (b), has to run around an
assistant coach (no contact), (c), runs into an assistant coach (contact) in the
restricted area, or (d), runs into A’s HC (contact) on the field of play at the
50 YL.

7. After the end of a play, a fight breaks out between the teams. An injured
   player (in street clothes wearing his jersey) runs out onto the field and
participates in the incident.

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. With the Point Differential in effect and 25 seconds left in the game, the
   winning HC tells the crew he’s not going to snap the ball. The LJ, LM, U, and
BJ all run off the field leaving the R standing behind the huddle with the clock
at 22 seconds.

9. The LM, LJ, and BJ decide to have game balls of each team on both sides of
   the side lines making it easier to bring in a new ball when one goes OOB.

## OHSAA Regulations
10. At the start of the game the VT runs out onto the field and begins to stomp
    on the HT’s logo at the 50 YL.
