## Free Kicks and Fair Catch
1. On a KO, K27 kicks the ball near the SL and it rolls OOB at R’s 20 YL. R’s
   captain elects to take the ball at his 35 YL and asks for it to be placed in
the middle of the field.

2. On a FK from K’s 40 YL, K1 attempts an onside kick to the near side of the
   field. The ball is rolling in the NZ when R3 steps up to recover it. K1
blocks R3 away from the ball. The ball continues to roll across midfield where
K2 recovers it on R’s 48 YL. Prior to K1’s block, R7 initiated contact with K8
on the far side of the field at K’s 46 YL.

3. K1’s KO is airborne over R’s 48 YL, but a gust of wind blows it back to K’s
   47 YL where it touches the ground and K90 falls on the ball.

4. K1’s KO is driven into the ground off the tee and bounces high into the air.
   K2 out jumps R1 at R’s 49 YL and is downed there.

5. R1 gives a FC signal just as R44 begins to advance after catching a punt.

6. After a FC following a punt, A snaps the ball from B’s 45 YL. A24 gains 10
   yards on a running play and during the down B58 grasped and pulled A24’s face
mask. The play ends in a side zone. The penalty moves the ball to B’s 20 YL. A
now wishes to try a FK for a FG and have the ball spotted in the middle of the
field.

7. R1 is standing on his 30 YL and is struck on the shoulder by a punt that is
   beyond the NZ. After the ball has hit R1, R2 signals for a FC at R’s 25 YL.
The ball rolls OOB at R’s 18 YL.

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. During the 2nd half with the Point Differential Rule in effect, runner A1

Differential Rule part of the game?

9. After the Try, there is a dead ball foul before the KO. What is the procedure
   the R and BJ are to use to enforce the dead ball foul?

## OHSAA Regulations
10. In the first half an assistant coach receives an UNS for berating an
    official. During the second half the HC of the same team receives a UNS. The
HC is ejected for two UNS.
