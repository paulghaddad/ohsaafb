answers](https://storage.googleapis.com/ohsaa-websites/quizzes/2013/2013-Black-and-White-Quiz-12.pdf).

## OHSAA Rules
1. During the game it is discovered that several of the players of A are wearing
   “basketball” type pull up knee pads only and no pad in the pants. Legal or
illegal?

2. During the first quarter, the crew notices that A is using large sign boards
   with pictures of hot dogs, hamburgers, French fires, and other items to
communicate with the team. Are these billboard type pictures legal or do they
constitute a device to communicate with players?

3. After an incomplete pass with the down marker showing third down, it is
   realized it was actually fourth down. The error was made when the down was
not changed after the (a) first down play, (b) second down play, or (c) third
down play. Can a correction be made?

4. After a fifth down play (the Crew miscounted), A still behind the LTG. It is
   discovered that A has been given an extra down. Can this correction be made?

5. During a fifth down play(oops – they miscounted again!), A is flagged for (a)
   illegal formation, (b) holding, (c) taunting. How are the penalties handled
during a fifth down play?

6. A, 1/10 @ A 35. A32 runs for five yards and the down marker is changed to
   third down (should have been second down). An incomplete pass is thrown and
the marker is flipped to fourth down (should have been third down). The error is
caught.

7. With the down marker showing fourth down, K punts and a FC is made. It is
   then recognized the previous down should have been third down.

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. The HC for the VT questions a ruling on a play and asks to see the ruling in
   the Rules Book. The officials have left their Rule Books in the locker room.

9. Punt Play. The ball is on the opposite HM. Should the wing official be 10
   yards wide of the widest K player since you have the wide side of the field?

## OHSAA Regulations
10. It’s the first week (Week 11) of the state tournament games. The crew is in
    the locker room and the visiting team brings in their game balls for
approval. The U is checking the balls when he notices that the game balls are
Nike brand footballs.
