This week’s Rules Geek is prepared by Dave Ramsey in association with Beau Rugg
and Dr. Bruce Maurer. [Click here to view a PDF of the quiz along with the
answers](https://storage.googleapis.com/ohsaa-websites/quizzes/2015/2015-Your-Call-Quiz-1.pdf).

## Rules
1. A K1 attempt to down a punt beyond the neutral zone, but his touching slows
   it down. The bouncing ball is subsequently recovered by R1, who advances 25
yards, but then fumbles and K2 recovers. K2 is immediately tackled. Where, if
anywhere, can the RT get the football?

2. K2, running toward RT's end zone, leaps in the air to catch K1's punt which
   is in flight. K2 has the ball in his grasp over the 1 YL, but first touches
the ground in RT's end zone. No player of the RT is in position to catch the
punt.

3. A scrimmage kick by K1 is partially blocked in the neutral zone by R1. The
   kick goes beyond the neutral zone where R2 muffs it back behind the neutral
zone. K2 recovers behind the neutral zone and advances across R's goal line.

4. With third and 10 on K's 10­yard line, K1's punt is blocked and recovered on
   K's 4­yard line simultaneously by K2 and R1.Will it be forth down for K or
first down for R?

5. K1’s punt beyond the neutral zone hits the ground. The ball bounces high into
   the air. R3 gives a fair catch signal. K3 slightly bumps R2 before R2
completes the catch. Did K commit Kick catching interference (KCI)?

6. R1 is in position to catch a punt. K2 runs downfield to a point about a foot
   in front of R1 as the ball descends. R1 catches the punt with having to
adjust his position due to K2’s location. K2 immediately tackles R1. Has K
committed KCI?

7. What choices does the RT have if the KT commits KCI?

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. Late in the football game A leads by a score of 28 – 20. A’s HC notifies the
   Wing, who immediately notifies the R of A’s plans to “take a knee”. Both
officials note that B has no remaining time outs. The R and wing immediately
notify A players and HC to “protect themselves” as the Victory Formation is not
in effect should they continue.

9. An eligible pass receiver runs downfield close to the sideline where the wing
   moves in extremely close in order to better see the catch.

## OHSAA Regulations
10. During the first scrimmage of the season a player is ejected for fighting.
    The official asks the coach for information in order to complete the OHSAA
ejection form online. The coach mentions that this player wasn’t expected to
play in the next scrimmage anyway. The official informs the head coach that this
player will be ineligible to play week 1 of the season.
