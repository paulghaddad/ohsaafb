answers](https://storage.googleapis.com/ohsaa-websites/quizzes/2014/2014_black_and_white_quiz_31.pdf).

## Rules
1. After a successful Try, there is a PF against the RT. The penalty is enforced
   and K’s KO is from R’s 45 YL. The kick goes OOB untouched at R’s 10 YL. What
are R’s options?

2. A22 on a sweep to the right, “straight arms” B55’s helmet in an attempt to
   avoid being tackled. Legal?

3. B36 is attempting to tackle QB A12 when he (a) makes illegal helmet contact,
   (b) grasps and pulls A12’s face mask, or (c) commits a horse collar tackle.
The pass is thrown forward and incomplete. Same set of circumstances, but A12
keeps the ball and is tackled behind the LOS.

4. K1 identifies himself as the kicker to the BJ on a FK. K1 stays between K’s
   35 –&40 YL after the RFP. There are 5 players on each side of K1. K2, who is
standing next to K1, loops around K1, staying within the 5 yard belt, and kicks
the ball.

5. Actual game. A is behind 22 – 20 with 1:10 left in the fourth quarter. A1, on
   fourth down, completes a forward pass that is close to a first down. The down
field officials stop the clock and the R signals a first down. The chain crew
moves to the new location. As the R slowly gets down field, he realizes that
it’s not a first down. The R then rules that the ball is short of a first down
and awards the ball to B. Can a correction be made?

6. A, 3/G at B’s 1 YL with 12 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and A is
   behind by four points, A16 advances to the 1⁄2 YL. B13 commits a 5 yard face
mask penalty during the play. The clock is stopped with five seconds remaining
in the game. The clock is restarted when the ball is marked RFP. Before A can
snap the ball, time expires.

7. A, 4/7 at B’s 42 YL. A26 runs OOB and picks up 6 yards. B6 commits a dead
   ball late hit. How should the R handle signaling?

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. During the 2nd half with the Point Differential Rule in effect, K1 onside
   kicks the ball & K2 recovers the kick after it goes 10 yards & touches the
ground. How is the clock handled?

9. After an incomplete pass the BJ throws the ball to the SL by bouncing it on
   the ground or kicks it to the ball persons.

## OHSAA Regulations
10. With over a minute left in the game the VT’s HC, in frustration, walks onto
    the field with his team & concedes defeat. The time on the clock does not
expire.
