Rugg and Dr. Bruce Maurer. [Click here to view a PDF of the quiz along with the
answers](https://storage.googleapis.com/ohsaa-websites/quizzes/2014/2014_black_and_white_quiz_11.pdf).

## Rules
1. A, 3/G on B’s 4 YL. After a TO, A is set on their LOS when all four defensive
   B players do a coordinated “belly flop” on the ground which causes A 68 to
false start.

2. A, 1/10 at B’s 38 YL. QB A2 takes the snap and runs to his right. A2 stops
   and turns to his left and throws a backward pass to A37 about 15 yards from
A2. After A2 throws the pass he is hit by B54 and knocked to the ground. A37
runs the ball to B’s 35 YL. The HC of A confronts the LOS official and wants B
penalized for RTP.

3. Can the snapper be hit on a “muddle huddle” play if they (a), snap and kick,
   or (b), the snapper goes out for a pass?

4. A, 4/21 at B’s 24 YL. A10 completes a pass to A88 who runs to B’s 4 YL where
   he throws a forward pass to A81 who runs into B’s EZ. In (a), time expires
during the play in the second period, or in (b), the play happens during the
middle of the second period.

5. A-21, B-29. A, 4/9 at B’s 21 YL with 5 seconds on the GC in the fourth
   quarter. QB A7 throws a legal forward pass to A18 who catches the ball for a
TD. Time expires during the down. A scores a successful two point Try. In (a),
B17 commits DPI during the Try, or (b), B17 commits an UNS foul after the Try.
How should the R explain the options on the coin toss?

6. B34 recovers A’s fumble and returns the ball for 20 yards before being
   tackled by A73 who grasps B34’s FM. During B34’s run B29 clips.

7. The game clock is stopped because A44 is bleeding. A then requests a TO
   during which A44 receives medical treatment, his bleeding stops and the wound
is covered. Can A44 return to the game after the TO?

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. In Quiz 8 the ruling stated that all dead ball fouls are enforced separately
   and in the order of their occurrence. They do not offset.

9. On a short first down measurement outside of the HMs, the R picks up the
   football and chain and repositions the ball at the nearest HM.

## OHSAA Regulations
10. The U/LM notifies the VT with a 4 minute warning at halftime and then return
    to the field. The VT is late returning to the field.
