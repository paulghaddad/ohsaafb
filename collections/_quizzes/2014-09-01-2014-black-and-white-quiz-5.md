answers](https://storage.googleapis.com/ohsaa-websites/quizzes/2014/2014_black_and_white_quiz_5.pdf).

## Rules
1. K is attempting an onside kick. K1 drives the ball into the ground and the
   ball bounces high into the air and crosses R’s restraining line (breaks the
plane). The ball is in the air and R36 is looking up at the ball at R’s 48 YL
when K89 blocks R36 (not targeting). Is R36 a defenseless player?

2. K, 4/7 at B’s 15 YL. K13 is in position to kick. Holder K34, (a) fumbles the
   ball as he places it and he recovers the ball with his knee still on the
ground and then rises and runs to B’s 7 YL & tackled, or (b), muffs the snap;
the ball rolls away and K34 rises to recover and then returns to his knees to
place the ball at B’s 22 YL.

3. A16 runs toward the right SL and is tackled at B’s 40 YL. During the run, A89
   jerks B19’s helmet off while both are OOB at B’s 46 YL. Where is the penalty
enforced?

4. A, 4/G on B’s 6 YL. A40 tries the left side and (a) with his feet still
   inbounds, extends the ball over the SL and breaks the plane of the GL
extended. He is then knocked OOB before any part of his body crosses the GL, or
(b) he dives and while airborne, the ball breaks the plane of the SL and then
the GL extended.

5. The ball is snapped from the right hash mark. A77 is called for holding at
   the LOS in the center of the field. In (a) the play ends 8 yards behind the
LOS on the left hash mark, or (b) the play ends 8 yards beyond the LOS at the
left hash mark. Where is the penalty enforced from?

6. In order to gain a first down does the ball have to be beyond the foremost
   rod on the line to gain equipment?

7. A, 2/15 at A’s 2 YL. A18 is tackled just beyond the GL (inches) with the long
   axis of the ball parallel to the GL. How do you handle the placement of the
ball?

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. At the end of each play the LJ and LM are coming all the way in to the pile.
   Is this the correct mechanic for normal plays?

9. What is the proper mechanic for throwing the flag on dead ball fouls and
   fouls at the snap?

## OHSAA Regulations
10. As the VT is being brought out from the stadium for the 2nd half, students
    from the HT start throwing debris on the players.
