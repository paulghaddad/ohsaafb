## Rules
1. Late in the 4th quarter, A’s HC calls a TO. The LJ grants the TO. After
   granting the TO, the crew of officials realize that A does not have any TOs
remaining. The crew penalizes A for an UNS foul.

2. K, 4/14 at K’s 42 YL. K17’s kick is caught by R26 on R’s 4 YL and his
   momentum carries him into R’s EZ where he is tackled. After the catch, but
before R26 is tackled, R9 clips K52 (a) in R’s EZ, or, (b) at R’s 11 YL.

3. A1 is carrying the ball down the SL when B33 legally contacts him on the
   field of play, knocking A1 OOB. As A1 contacts the ground OOB his helmet
comes off. Does A1 have to leave the game for a play if his helmet comes off
after a play and OOB?

4. A scores a TD and during the down, B commits a 5 yard FM foul. A chooses to
   enforce the penalty on the KO. A runs for a successful 2 point Try and during
the Try, B commits a 15 yard FM foul. A also chooses to enforce this foul on the
KO. Are both fouls enforced on the KO since both fouls are live ball fouls?

5. B12 intercepts A16’s legal forward pass at midfield. At A’s 10 YL he is hit
   and the ball pops into the air. The ball is caught by A80 at A’s 4 YL and his
momentum carries him into the EZ where he is downed.

6. A26 fumbles at B’s 4 YL and the ball rolls into the EZ. B66 bats the ball
   over the EL to prevent an opponent from recovering it.

7. In the 1st period A is warned and then later penalized 5 yards for SL
   interference for having more than 3 coaches in the restricted area. The same
infraction occurs again in the third and again in the fourth period .How are
these situations penalized?
