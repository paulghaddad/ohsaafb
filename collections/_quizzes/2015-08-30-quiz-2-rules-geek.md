## NFHS Rules
1. A1 is wearing tinted sunglasses under his helmet which has a clear visor
   attached. The U informs A’s HC this is not permitted since A1 is wearing a
visor.

2. A1’s fumble rolls OOB @ B’s 25 YL. The GC will start on the R’s RFP signal
   after the U spots the ball.

3. Before the game the VT HC complains to the crew about the EZ pylons being
   yellow in color. The R informs the game management pylons are required to be
orange.

4. A scores a TD during the last timed down of the 1Q. B1 is flagged for
   roughing the passer on the successful 2 pt. try. A accepts the penalty and
the R announces the quarter will be extended for the free kick.

5. K, 4/10 @ K’s 20 YL. K1’s short punt is muffed by R1 @ K’s 30 YL. The loose
   ball rolls behind the neutral zone and K2 recovers the loose ball @ K’s 18
YL. K2 throws a forward pass to eligible K3 but the pass falls incomplete. The R
signals 1/10 for R at the KT’s 20 YL.

6. A, 2/5 @ B’s 25 YL. After breaking the huddle A’s linemen come to the LOS and
   get set. B1 yells “shift red” and B’s linemen abruptly shift. A1 false starts
as B’s linemen shift. The LJ informs the R it was B’s shift that caused A to
false start. The R signals encroachment on B.

7. A1 is illegally in motion at the snap. A2 throws a legal forward pass that is
   intercepted by B1 who scores a TD. The R announces B has chosen to have the
penalty enforced on the Try.

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. During the CT the HT speaker for the toss comes out without his game jersey
   or shoulder pads on and only wearing his football pants and a compression
shirt. The R informs the HT HC all captains must be legally equipped for the CT.

9. The chain crew is dressed with striped referee shirts. The HL informs the
   chain crew they may not be dressed in striped shirts and must change into
something else or cover the shirts with other attire.

## OHSAA Regulations
10. During the first scrimmage down of the game the R notices the HT is using a
    drone over the field. The drone is not interfering with the game, however
the R informs game management the drone is not permitted to be flown over the
playing field during the game.
