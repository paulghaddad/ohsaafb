This week's Black and White prepared by Larry Clemmons in association with Beau
Rugg and Dr. Bruce Maurer. [Click here to view a PDF of the quiz along with the
answers](https://storage.googleapis.com/ohsaa-websites/quizzes/2014/2014_black_and_white_quiz_12.pdf).

## Rules
1. K is attempting a FG. The holder receives the snap and then, with his knee on
   the ground, (a) passes the ball over his head to K7 who throws a forward pass
to A87 for a TD, or (b) passes the ball forward to up back A26 who runs for a
first down.

2. A, 3/7 at B’s 37 YL. QB A10 rolls out and throws the ball forward from B’s 32
   YL. The pass is incomplete. The LJ has a flag for an ineligible down field.
The R has a flag for an illegal FP. Ruling: A, 4/7 at B’s 37 YL. Rule 7-5-12
says, “...Ineligible A players may not advance beyond

3. If the runner is hit and his helmet comes off and the ball becomes loose
   simultaneously,what is the ruling? Is the ball dead for a runner’s helmet
coming off or live because the player ceases to be a runner when the ball
becomes loose?

4. With the Point Differential Rule in effect and with two minutes left in the
   game,(a) the HC of the winning team says he is not going to snap the ball
again and take multiple delay of game penalties or, (b) with A behind on their
own 35 YL the B’s HC yells out “special”, and one of his players walks across
the LOS and contacts an A player. The HC continues to call “special” hoping to
run out the clock.

5. A, 2/8 at A’s 40 YL. QB A7 takes the snap, drops back and throws a screen
   pass to eligible A24 who is at A’s 38 YL. A24 muffs the ball into the air and
lineman A75 catches the ball behind the LOS at A’s 37 YL and (a), carries the
ball forward to the 50 YL, or (b), carries the ball forward, is hit and fumbles
the ball at B’s 45 YL.

6. A, 2/15 at A’s 5 YL. A10 drops back to pass, and is sacked five yards deep in
   the EZ by B99 who makes the tackle by twisting A10’s face mask.

7. A, 3/18 at A’s 8 YL. The clock is running with about a minute remaining in
   the first half. A66 commits a false start.

## OHSAA Mechanics
8. Coin toss. The R signals the team receiving, and then taps the shoulder of
   the team who won the toss, and signals deferring to the second half.

9. On a FK return, the LJ is even with the ball carrier when he is tackled.

## OHSAA Regulations
10. Week 11 (playoffs). One of the teams submits their Nike game balls they have
    used all year for approval.

This is the last Black and White Quiz for 2014. I hope the quizzes helped make
you a better official. Thanks for all your plays and comments. Good luck to
those working the playoffs.
