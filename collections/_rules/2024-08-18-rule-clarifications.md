OHSAA has posted rule clarifications for the 2024 season.

<!--more-->

# Guardian Caps


1. Guardian Caps are a hot item and topic. They are LEGAL by NFHS Rules for practice and games. 

2. The NFHS and the OHSAA do not scientifically test or endorse football equipment. We can only tell you what is legal. Whenever you are adding to or altering equipment (such as the helmet) you should contact your equipment manufacturer to see if there are issues.


# NFHS Items


1. Mouthguards

a. The Shock Doctor mouth guards with charms (cross or other) are legal under the current NFHS Rules. Here are 2 examples:

* [3D Chain Jewel Max AirFlow Football Lipguard - Shock Doctor](https://www.shockdoctor.com/collections/mouthguards-fit-lip-guards/products/3d-chain-jewel-max-airflow-mouthguard-black-gold-money?variant=42362444546220)

* [3D Jewel King Max AirFlow Football Lipguard - Shock Doctor](https://www.shockdoctor.com/products/3d-jewel-king-max-airflow-mouthguard?variant=42362445299884)

 

b. The Battle mouthguards such as the  “Binky” and “Spinner” (links below ) are NOT LEGAL under NFHS Rules because of safety concerns for the athlete.

* [Binky Football Mouthguard - Battle Sports](https://battlesports.com/binky-oxygen-football-mouthguard/)

2. Heat Stroke: [Here is a link to a document from the NFHS on Heat Stroke prevention](https://ohsaaweb.blob.core.windows.net/files/Sports/Football/2024/Preventing-exertional-heat-stroke-in-football-Anderson.pdf)


# OHSAA Items


1. Ejections - We have had more ejections in the first scrimmage than I can remember. Coaches, players and officials need to treat these contests as learning opportunities. There is no reason to get out of control at a scrimmage.
