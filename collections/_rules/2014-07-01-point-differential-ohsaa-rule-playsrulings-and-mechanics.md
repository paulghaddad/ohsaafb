During the 2nd half, any time the score differential reaches 30 points or more
the game clock (GC) will be stopped only when: 1. An official’s time-out is
called for an injured player; 2. A charged time-out is called; 3. A change of
possession (COP) occurs at the end of the down; 4. At the end of a period; 5. A
score occurs; or 6. An extended delay. The GC will start again on the ready for
play (RFP) signal for the first play after the above situations. The GC will
continue to run in all other situations. (The use of this Rule does not preclude
the use of NFHS Rule 3-1-3). After the 30 point differential has been met, if
the score drops below 30 points, the GC reverts to regular timing rules.
Communicate with HC’s when it starts. It is imperative the LJ meets with the
Timer before the game to review this Rule at all levels.

Plays/Rulings below occur under the OHSAA Point Differential Rule during the 2nd
half, unless noted.

Play: Crew arrives at the field for a game. Ruling. After completing preliminary
duties the LJ will discuss this Rule with the Timer. Give the Timer a card
listing the Rules & emphasize the R mechanics for starting & stopping the GC.
Play. Late in 2nd quarter A scores & goes ahead 31 -0. Ruling. The Point
Differential Rule does NOT start until the 3rd quarter. Standard timing rules
are used for the entire 1st half.
Play. A scores a TD & goes ahead 31 – 0. Ruling. Point Differential Rule starts
when the R marks the ball RFP & winds the GC for the KO or, in middle school,
for 1st down. The clock does not run during the Try. The Wings will notify both
HC’s that the Point Differential Rule is in effect.
Play. A is ahead 31 – 0. KT KO’s to RT & RT runs it back to 30 YL. Ruling. GC
stops since there was a COP at the end of the down. The GC starts when the R
marks the ball RFP & winds the GC.
Play. A is ahead 31 – 0. A- 1 throws a pass that is intercepted. B -1 returns it
10 YDS & is tackled. Ruling. GC is stopped since there was a COP at the end of
the down. When the R marks the ball RFP he will wind the GC.
Play. A is ahead 31 – 0. A-1 throws pass, B-1 intercepts, B-1 returns, hit,
fumbles, & A-3 recovers the fumble. Ruling: Since A has the ball at the end of
the down, the GC continues to run. The same ruling would apply on a KO or punt
play.
Play. A is behind 31 – 0. A scores a TD & 1 point Try. Score is now B – 31 & A –
7. Ruling. Since the score differential is now less than 30 points, revert to
   NFHS standard timing rules. Tell HC’s.
Play. A is ahead 31 – 0. It is a hot & humid game & R stops game for extra water
breaks. Ruling.
This is an extended delay. Stop the GC for the water breaks, then R marks ball
RFP & winds GC.
Play. A is ahead 31 – 0. A-3 is called for holding. Ruling. The GC continues to
run.

Mechanics:

1. When the Point Differential Rule is enforced the R will point at the timer, tap
his wrist, & give a wind signal with his index finger. The R will face the timer
each time he needs to wind the GC.
Other members of the Crew will continue to use Gold Book Signaling. LJ will
mirror R’s wind.
2. Lengthy discussions occurred about altering Signals. Officials from other states
that have used
a “running clock” have indicated they did not change their Signaling Mechanics.
3. It is the timer’s responsibility to know the Rule and then start/stop the clock
as needed. (6/12/14)
