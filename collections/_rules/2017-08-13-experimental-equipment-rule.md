OHSAA will implement the following experimental rule for this year only with
permission from NFHS.

When any required player equipment is missing or when illegal equipment is
found, correction shall be made before the player may participate. If the
missing or illegal equipment is detected during the down or subsequent dead ball
action related to the down without being directly attributable to a foul by an
opponent, the player shall be replaced for at least one down, unless halftime or
an overtime intermission occurs. This does not relate to prompt repair of
equipment that becomes illegal or defective through use.
